Modify the Ranking Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modify Segments
"""""""""""""""

To modify the ranking table with your data, specify the following information for each segment:

    -  **Recency** shows the number of days since the last order made by a customer. Measured in days. The fewer days has passed, the better must be the score.

    -  **Frequency** shows the total number of orders a customer placed in the course of the last 365 days. The more orders, the better the score.

    -  **Monetary value** shows the total amount of money spent in the course of the last 365 days. The more is spent, the better must be the score.

.. note::
    Note the following:

        -  Score 1 is considered the best.

        -  You need to specify only one of the thresholds, the other is filled in automatically.

    For information about how to define segments, see the `How the RFM Analysis Is Done <./rfm-user#how-the-rfm-analysis-is-done>`__ section of the `RFM Analysis <./rfm-user>`__ guide.
