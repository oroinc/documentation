Marketing Tools for Magento
---------------------------


Magento Web Tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To improve marketing and sales performance, OroCRM provides a tool that tracks user behavior data from your Magento Store.

OroCRM Tracking extension adds a pre-configured tracking code to your Magento store and collects the following events:

-  Page views

-  Registration of new users

-  Items added to carts

-  Start of order checkout

-  Successful order placement

These events are recorded in OroCRM making it possible for you to track your customer activity.

For how to configure such tracking, see :ref:`Magento Web Tracking topic <user-guide-magento-web-tracking>`.

RFM Analysis for Magento Customers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In OroCRM the RFM metrics are available for Magento customers. It is based on customer order history and helps evaluate customers from the following points:

- **Recency** — How long ago did the customer create their last order?
- **Frequency** — How often does the customer make orders?
- **Monetary value** — How much money did the customer spend on the orders?

More information on how RFM is configured in your Oro application can be found in the :ref:`RFM analysis topic <user-guide-rfm-user>`.

Magento Newsletter Subscribers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To facilitate integration between Oro and Magento, OroCRM enables customers to see the  list of Magento newsletter subscribers. More details on how to upload it into your Oro application, follow the guidelines described in :ref:`Magento Newsletter Subscribers topic <user-guide-magento-entities-newsletters>`.

Magento Abandoned Cart Campaigns

abandoned carts.

   become abandoned.
