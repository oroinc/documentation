| **Name**       | Name used to refer to the record in the system                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note:: Connecting a tracking record with a channel in the system binds events registered by the tracking engine and other CRM data like orders, shopping carts, customer profiles, etc. This connection can be further utilized in reports and segments.



-  Once you have completed filling in the Create Website Record form,
   click :guilabel:`Save and Close`.

Step 4: Check User Events
-------------------------

As soon as you have configured website tracking, you should be able to
see customer activity in the **Events** section of the tracking website
record you have just created.

Five events are tracked by default:

-  **Page views**: Every time a user gets to the page, a **Visit** event
   is logged.

-  **Registration of new users:** As soon as a user registers, a
   **Registration** event is logged.

-  **Items added to carts:** a **Cart Item Added** event is logged when
   a user adds an item to the cart.

-  **Start of order checkout:** a **User Entered Checkout** event is
   logged when a user starts their checkout process.

-  **Order placement:** An **Order successfully placed** event is logged
   when a user places their order.

These events are illustrated in the screenshot below:

   :alt: Customer activity in the events section of the tracking website record


In addition, activities of a specific customer are displayed in the **Website Activity** section of their view page in Summary and Events:

Step 5: Use Collected Data
--------------------------

You can use data collected from your Magento store in a number of ways,
creating reports and segments of users according to your needs.

Build a Segment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building segments of your customers is one of many ways of using data
collected through web tracking.

As an example, let us build a segment of users who have not visited the
website for more than a month.

To do this, go to **Reports and Segments>Manage Segments** and click
:guilabel:`Create Segment`.

In the **Filters** section:

-  Drag a **Field Condition** to the field on the right to set
   conditions to the segment.

-  Select **Magento Customer/Magento Customer (Visitor event)/Web
   event>Logged at.**

-  Set the following variables: **not between today** and **today-30**
   as illustrated in the screenshot below.

-  When you are done, click :guilabel:`Save and Close`.


.. image:: ../../img/web_tracking_magento/create_segment.jpg
   :alt: Building a segment of users who have not visited the website for more than a month


The segment will appear on the **Manage Segments** page and contain
customers sorted according to your conditions.

Create a Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another example of using data, collected with the help of web tracking,
is creating reports. Let us create a report that will display how many
users have visited your websites, registered and placed their orders.

-  Go to **Reports&Segments>Manage Custom Reports**

-  Click :guilabel:`Create report`.

-  For entity type select **Tracking Website**.

   In **Columns** section add:

-  Tracking Website>Name

-  Tracking Website/Tracking website (Visitor event)/Web event>Name

-  Tracking Website/Tracking website (Visitor event)/Web event>Name, set
   function to **Count**

   In **Grouping**, add:

-  Tracking Website>Name

-  Tracking Website/Tracking website (Visitor event)/Web event>Name

   In **Filters**, set the following condition:

-  Tracking Website/Tracking website (Visitor event)/Web event>Name,
   field value **is any of** **visit, registration, order placed.**

-  Click :guilabel:`Save and Close`.

   :alt: Creating a new report to display how many users have visited the websites, registered and placed their orders.


Once you have saved your report, you will be able to see how many users
have visited your websites, registered there and placed their orders, as
shown in the following example:

.. image:: ../../img/web_tracking_magento/TrackingWebsitereport.png

In similar manner, using website tracking data, you can create custom
reports that fit specifically your needs and the needs of your business.
