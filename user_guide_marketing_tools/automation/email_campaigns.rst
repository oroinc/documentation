Email Campaigns
===============

Want to send a congratulation letter to all of your loyal customers born in June?

Want to make a special offer to every customer who has purchased from you since April?

OroCRM enables creation of email campaigns.  This means that once you have defined the rules for generation of a
:ref:`Marketing List <user-guide-marketing-lists>` or a :ref:`Magento Abandoned Cart Campaigns <user-guide-acc>`, and have created an :ref:`Email Template <user-guide-email-template>`, you can easily set-up an Email Campaign, within which all the contacts on the list will
receive personalized emails in compliance with the campaign.

This article describes how to set up an Email Campaign in OroCRM and manage it.

.. _user-guide-email-campaigns-create:

Create Email Campaign Records

- Go to the *Email Campaigns* page.

- Click the :guilabel:`Create Email Campaign` button.

General Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  There are four mandatory fields that **must** be defined:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Name***","Name used to refer to the campaign in the system."
  "**Marketing List***","Choose one of available marketing lists. The letter will be sent to email addresses defined by
  the list.
  More details about the marketing lists are available in the :ref:`Marketing Lists <user-guide-marketing-lists>`
  guide."
  "**Schedule***","Defines whether the mailing shall be activated manually (*Manual*) or scheduled for a specific
  date (*Deferred*).

  If *Deferred* is chosen, the **Scheduled For** field will appear. Choose the date and time of the mailing in the
  calendar.

  |email_campaign_schedule|"
  "**Owner***","Limits the list of users that can manage the campaign to those,  whose
  :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` allow managing
  email campaigns of the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.)."

Optional fields can be used to define such details as the way to represent the sender's email address and name in the
emails.

Custom fields may be added, subject to specific business needs.

.. _user-guide-email-campaigns-plus-marketing:

Any amount of email campaigns can be assigned to one marketing campaign.
