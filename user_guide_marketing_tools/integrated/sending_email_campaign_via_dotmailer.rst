Prepare Data for the Campaign in OroCRM
---------------------------------------

Email campaigns are based on data in :ref:`marketing lists <user-guide-marketing-lists>`.

In order to prepare a campaign in OroCRM, you need to create a marketing list first. This list will be synchronized with the dotmailer address book.

Go to **Marketing>Marketing Lists** and click **Create Marketing List.**

+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Field**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                           |
+=================+===========================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| **Name**        | Name used to refer to the marketing list in the system.                                                                                                                                                   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Description** | Optional field. Can be filled with text to help you and other users understand the purpose of the list in future.                                                                                         |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Entity**      | Data to be synchronized into the Marketing list will depend on the entity that you select.                                                                                                                |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Type**        | Type refers to the type of marketing list update. **Dynamic Type** means that all changes you make to your marketing list will be automatic. **On Demand** means that updates will be performed manually. |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Owner**       | The user who is responsible for the marketing list.                                                                                                                                                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You can add multiple columns to your marketing list but at least one column must contain contact information. In our
case, it is vital to add an email column along with the first and last
name of the contact.

Click :guilabel:`Save and Close` when you are finished.

Sync OroCRM Marketing List Data with dotmailer Address Book
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once the integration has been configured and its status has been set to **Active**, the list of address books will be automatically imported from dotmailer to OroCRM. At this point, Oro marketing lists can be connected to existing dotmailer address books.

As an illustration, let us create a new **Address Book** on the dotmailer side.

In your dotmailer account, navigate to the upper-right corner and select **My
Contacts** from the dropdown. Clicking the **New Address Book** button
will redirect you to a page with the following fields to fill in:

+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Field**       | **Description**                                                   |
+=================+===================================================================+
| **Name**        | Enter the name for your address to identify it within the system. |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Folder**      | By default, Address Books is the selected folder.                 |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Description** | Add description for the address book if necessary.                |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

   :alt: Address book form

Click **Save** when you are done.

.. hint:: In OroCRM, you can add new address books straight from **Connect to dotmailer** dialog box.

Now, we need to upload contacts from OroCRM into our newly created
address book in dotmailer. In order for OroCRM to see this address book:


1.  Go back to OroCRM.

2.  Navigate to **System>Manage Integrations**.

3.  Select your dotmailer integration.

4.  Click **Schedule Sync** in the upper-right corner.

You can map contacts from OroCRM marketing list into your dotmailer
address book the following way:

1.  Navigate to **Marketing>Marketing Lists** and select the list you would like to use.

2.  Click **Connect to dotmailer** in the upper-right corner.

   .. image:: ../../img/dotmailer_email_campaign/connect_dotmailer_button.jpg
      :alt: Contact to dotmailer in the marketing list

A pop up form will emerge will the following fields to be defined:

+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Field**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
+=========================+======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| **Integration**         | Choose your **Integration** from the list of integrations available in your OroCRM  instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Address Book**        | Select the address book that we have just created from the list of all dotmailer address books available for connection. Note that the list will not contain the **All Contacts** and **Test** address books that are automatically generated in dotmailer. Nor will it contain the address books that have already been connected to another marketing list in Oro. |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Create new Entities** | This check box controls whether new entities can be created. If a contact is found in an address book but no email match in the application is found, a new entity will be created in the application based on the mapping setup. A new entity will be created only if **two way sync** mapping is configured for each of the entity's required fields.              |
+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

As soon as the connection has been saved, contacts from the marketing list will be automatically exported from Oro to dotmailer. Since then, data synchronization (import and export) between Oro and dotmailer will be performed automatically every 4 minutes.

.. note:: One marketing list may only be connected to one dotmailer address book, and vice versa. Therefore, each connected Oro marketing list will be represented as an address book in dotmailer. Also, note that only marketing lists with email fields can be connected.

.. image:: ../../img/dotmailer_email_campaign/connect_dotmailer_address_book.jpg
   :alt: Connect to dotmailer form

Once you have connected your marketing list, you will notice a
**dotmailer button** appear at the top (instead of **Connect to dotmailer**) with the following actions in the
dropdown:

+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Field**               | **Description**                                                                                                                    |
+=========================+====================================================================================================================================+
| **Synchronize**         | Start sync between the marketing list and the address book manually.                                                               |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Refresh Data Fields** | Manually mark all marketing lists updated to make sure data fields data is up to date in dotmailer after the next synchronization. |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Connection Settings** | Change connection or integration for the current marketing list in OroCRM.                                                         |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Disconnect**          | Disconnect the list from the segment.                                                                                              |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

At this point, if you go back to dotmailer, you will be able to see data
from OroCRM (subscribers’ first and last names and contact details)
synced into your dotmailer address book.

Create and Send Campaign on the dotmailer Side

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

5.  Personalization is available for two fields: **Subject Line** and **Friendly From Name**.

    It is possible to prefix the recipient’s name with the data stored in OroCRM. You can do this by clicking on the icon above the field (as shown in the screenshot) and selecting the personalization option that suits you best from the dropdown menu.

Check Statistics for Your Campaign
----------------------------------

To check the statistics for your campaign on the dotmailer side,
navigate to **Reporting>Campaign Reports** in the upper-right corner.

Receive Campaign Statistics on the OroCRM Side
----------------------------------------------

Once you have sent out your email campaign in dotmailer, information
about your email campaign should have been exported to OroCRM.

As soon as export has been completed, your email campaign should appear
in **Marketing>Email Campaigns**. By clicking on your recent campaign,
you will be able to see subscriber activity statistics, such as the
number of clicks, bounces, opens, etc. Numbers in each column for each
contact define the number of times an action has been performed, e.g. 2
opens, 1 click, 1 unsubscribe.

.. image:: ../../img/dotmailer_email_campaign/oro_statistics_email_campaign_dotmailer.jpg
   :alt: Email campaign statistics displayed o the details page of this campaign in the Oro application

These statistics will help you understand the outcome of your campaign
and let you filter contacts for the next one.

For example, if you want to send your next email campaign to those contacts who have opened your previous emails, go to **Marketing>Marketing List>** and click **Create New Marketing List**. Fill in the mandatory fields, remembering to include at least one contact column below.

In the **Filters** section:

1.	Drag **Field Condition** to set conditions to the list.
2.	Select **Contact>Marketing List>Marketing List (Email Campaign)/Email Campaign (dotmailer Campaign)/Activities>Opens Number**.
3.	Set field value to '=1.'
4.	When you are done, click :guilabel:`Save and Close`.

   .. image:: ../../img/dotmailer_email_campaign/oro_statistics_general_opens.jpg
      :alt: Example of using email campaign statistics results to create a new marketing list


This list will now appear in the marketing list page and will contain all contacts who have opened your previous emails.

Similarly, you can apply any conditions of your choice.
