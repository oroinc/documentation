Entities
========

OroCommerce equips users and developers with powerful UIs that they can use to manage both simple and complex data entities, including all entity attributes (fields) and relations. As a developer, you can easily enable standard CRUD pages for a new entity, and with the same ease, you can add more fields to any of the entities that you have created before by adding new entity properties, creating a migration script and modifying the templates.

In the sections below, you can learn the key things you can come across when working with entities in the Oro application:
