Add OroCommerce Capabilities to an OroCRM Application
=====================================================

.. note:: Before installing OroCommerce over OroCRM, you should change default parameter ``web_backend_prefix`` to some non-empty prefix that should start with "/" but do not finish with "/", e.g., '/admin'.

.. warning:: To avoid access permissions issues, please review the Symfony |Setting up or Fixing File Permissions|  guide before running any commands. On top of that, consider running the command(s) below with `sudo -u [web server user name]` prefix.

To install OroCommerce and OroCRM from scratch, please :ref:`install OroCommerce application <installation>` that has OroCRM capabilities embedded out-of the-box.

To add OroCommerce to an existing instance of OroCRM, please follow the ordinary :ref:`OroCRM upgrade process <upgrade-application>` and ensure you add the OroCommerce package as a dependency during the step 5. Once the upgrade process is complete, please run following commands to add necessary initial OroCommerce configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    php bin/console oro:config:update oro_website.url https://unsecure.url
    php bin/console oro:config:update oro_website.secure_url http://secure.url

where `http://unsecure.url` and `https://secure.url` are urls for the OroCommerce storefront. The ``oro:config:update`` command updates a configuration value in the global scope.
