@Config
=======

This annotation is used to configure default values for configurable entity classes.

Options
-------

``defaultValues``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configures default values for particular config options on a per property basis:

.. code-block:: php

    // ...
    use Oro\Bundle\EntityConfigBundle\Metadata\Annotation\Config;

    /**
     * @Config(
     *      defaultValues={
     *          "dataaudit"={
     *              "auditable"=true
     *          }
     *      }
     * )
     */
    class User
    {
        // ...
    }

This example sets the ``auditable`` option from the ``dataaudit`` scope to ``true`` for the ``User`` class.

You can use``immutable`` on any settings. This attribute can be used to prohibit changing the association state.

``activity``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This parameter sets default settings for OroActivityBundle. This bundle helps classify certain entity types as activities and enables a special relation type between an entity and activities. For more information, see :ref:`OroActivityBundle <bundle-docs-platform-activity-bundle>`.

* **show_on_page** *integer* - is used to change a page, which will display the "activity list" and activity buttons. Can be used as bitmask. Possible values are in ``\Oro\Bundle\ActivityBundle\EntityConfig\ActivityScope::VIEW_PAGE``.

* **route** *string* - is the route name for the controller that can be used to render the list of this type of activities. This controller must have $entityClass and $entityId. Parameters to pass the target entity. This attribute must be defined for each activity entity (an entity included in the 'activity' group, see 'grouping' scope).

* **acl** *string* - is used to check whether this type of activity is available in the current security context.

* **action_button_widget** *string* - is the widget name of the activity action used to render a button. This widget should be defined in placeholders.yml. This attribute can be defined for the activity entity. Please note that an activity should provide both action_link_widget and action_link_widget, because actions can be rendered both as a button as a dropdown menu.

* **action_link_widget** *string* - is the widget name of the activity action used to render a link in the dropdown menu. This widget should be defined in placeholders.yml. This attribute can be defined for the activity entity. Please note that an activity should provide both action_link_widget and action_link_widget, because actions can be rendered as a button as a dropdown menu.

* **activities** *string[]* - is the list of activities' class names that can be assigned to the entity.

* **inheritance_targets** *string[]* - are target entity classes whose activities will be shown in the current entity. If entity 1 has relation with entity 2 and activity is enabled for both of them, we can configure entity 1 using this option to show activities from related entity 2. In the example of the configuration for unidirectional relations below, we are going to join the "user" relation to the "Test" entity through the "Example" entity relation:

.. code-block:: none

    [
       [target] => Oro\Bundle\ExampleBundle\Entity\Test
       [path] => [
           [0] => [
                  [join] => Oro\Bundle\ExampleBundle\Entity\Example
                  [conditionType] => WITH
                  [field] => test_id
