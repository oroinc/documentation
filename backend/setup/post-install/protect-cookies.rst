Protect Cookies
===============

If the application is configured to be used via SSL connection, you may want to protect the application cookies, too.

Cookies are protected with **Secure** and **HttpOnly** flags.

By default, all cookies used in ORO applications have the **secure** flag set to ``auto``. This means that cookies will have the ``secure`` flag for HTTPS requests and no such flag for HTTP requests.

All cookies, except for the CSRF cookie, have **httponly** flag set to *true*. This means that the cookie will not be accessible
by scripting languages, such as JavaScript.

More information about this configuration is available in the |Cookie secure configuration| section of Symfony documentation.

If your application uses proxy that makes redirects from https requests to http, the application will detect that
the request was made with http request. As a result, the ``auto`` value for secure parameter will remove the **secure** flag.

In this case you can manually set this parameter for each cookie via the configuration or reconfigure your web sever
to add the **secure** flag by the server.

Reconfigure Apache Web Server
-----------------------------

To configure Apache web server:

- Enable mod_headers.so in the Apache HTTP server configuration file;
- In the configuration of your virtual domain, add:

  .. code-block:: none

      Header edit Set-Cookie ^(.*)$ $1;Secure

- Restart the web server.

Reconfigure Nginx Web Server with nginx_cookie_flag Module
----------------------------------------------------------

To configure Nginx web server, use the |nginx_cookie_flag_module|.

To use this module, the Nginx server has to be built with the following extension:

.. code-block:: none

    --add-module=/path/to/nginx_cookie_flag_module

Once Nginx is built with the above module, you can add the following line either to the location or the server
directive in the respective configuration file:

.. code-block:: none

    set_cookie_flag secure;

Reconfigure Nginx Web Server with proxy_cookie_path
---------------------------------------------------

Another option for Nginx is to use the ``proxy_cookie_path`` parameter in ``ssl.conf`` or ``default.conf``:

.. code-block:: none

    proxy_cookie_path / "/; Secure";
