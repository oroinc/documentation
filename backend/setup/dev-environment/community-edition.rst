Environment Setup for Community Edition
=======================================

This topic provides a detailed description of the environment setup process for Community Edition of Oro applications.

Before you proceed, please refer to the :ref:`System Requirements <system-requirements>` for the complete list of the recommended environmental components and their supported versions. If you are using the same environment and components, as described in the System Requirements, you can reuse the commands provided in this guide without modification. Otherwise, please adjust them to match the syntax supported by the tools of your choice.

Prepare a Server with OS
------------------------

Get a dedicated physical or virtual server with at least 4Gb RAM with the CentOS v7.4 installed. Ensure that you
can run processes as a *root* user or user with *sudo* permissions.

Environment Setup
-----------------

Enable Required Package Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the EPEL repository to your `yum` package manager by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   yum install -y epel-release
   yum update -y


Install Nginx, NodeJS, Git, Supervisor, and Wget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install most of the required Oro application environment components using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo bash -
   yum install -y nginx wget git nodejs supervisor yum-utils


Install MySQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you need to install MySQL 8.0 to replace the default MariaDB replica in CentoOS, get the MySQL 8.0 package from the MySQL official repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm && rpm -ivh mysql80-community-release-el7-1.noarch.rpm

Next, install MySQL 8.0 using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   yum install -y mysql-community-server

Install PHP
^^^^^^^^^^^

As you need to install PHP 7.4 instead of CentOS 7 native PHP 5.6 version, get the PHP 7.4 packages from the REMI repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm && rpm -Uvh remi-release-7.rpm
   yum-config-manager --enable remi-php74
   yum update -y

Next, install PHP 7.4 and the required dependencies using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   yum install -y php-fpm php-cli php-pdo php-mysqlnd php-xml php-soap php-gd php-mbstring php-zip php-intl php-opcache

Install Composer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the commands below, or use another Composer installation process described in the |official documentation|.

.. code-block:: bash

   php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');" && php composer-setup.php
   php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
   mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer

Enable Installed Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl start mysqld php-fpm nginx supervisord
   systemctl enable mysqld php-fpm nginx supervisord

Environment Configuration
-------------------------

Perform Security Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure *SELinux*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the production environment, it is strongly recommended to keep *SELinux* enabled in the *enforcing* mode.

.. warning:: The actual SELinux configuration depends on the real production server environment and should be configured by an experienced system administrator.

In this guide, to simplify installation in the local and development environment, we are loosening the SELinux mode by setting the permissive option for the **setenforce** mode.
However, your environment configuration may differ. If that is the case, please adjust the commands that will follow in the next sections to match your configuration.

.. code-block:: bash

   sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config
   setenforce permissive

Configure Users Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security reasons, we recommend performing all Oro application-related processes on behalf of two different linux users:

* **Administrative user** (for example, oroadminuser) --- A user should be able to perform administration operations like application installation, update, etc.
* **Application user** (for example, nginx) ---  A user should be able to perform runtime operations that require no changes in the application source code files.

In this guide, to simplify installation in the local and development environment, we are loosening
this requirement and use the superuser permissions to perform Oro application administrative tasks.
However, for your staging or production environment, please adjust the commands that will follow in the next
sections to run environment management commands as well as application install and update via a dedicated admin user.

Commands for running the web server, php-fpm process, cron commands, background processes, etc., are executed via the dedicated *application user* (*nginx*). Reuse them without modification, if you keep the same username. Otherwise, adjust them accordingly.

Prepare MySQL Database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the Default MySQL Password for Root User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find the temporary mysql *root* user password that was created automatically, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

Use this password to login to mysql CLI as root user and change the temporary password to the new secure one (we have used the `P@ssword123`):

.. code-block:: bash

   mysql -uroot -p
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@ssword123';

Replace `P@ssword123` with your secret password. Ensure it contains at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter,
one digit, and one special character, and has a total length of at least 8 characters.

Change the MySQL Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is recommended to use SSD to store the application data in the MySQL 8.X database. However, in case you do need to
use the HDD, set the following configuration parameters in the **/etc/my.cnf** file to avoid performance issues:

.. code-block:: none

   [mysqld]
   innodb_file_per_table = 0
   wait_timeout = 28800

To minimize the risk of long compilations of SQL queries (which sometimes may take hours or even days;
for details, see `MySQL documentation <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/controlling-query-plan-evaluation.html>`_),
set `optimizer_search_depth` to `0`:

.. code-block:: none

   [mysqld]
   optimizer_search_depth = 0

To store supplementary characters (such as 4-byte emojis), configure the options file to use the `utf8mb4` character
set:

.. code-block:: none

   [client]
   default-character-set = utf8mb4

   [mysql]
   default-character-set = utf8mb4

   [mysqld]
   character-set-server = utf8mb4
   collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

Set the default authentication plugin to mysql_native_password:

.. code-block:: none

   [mysqld]
   default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

For the changes to take effect, restart MySQL server by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl restart mysqld

Create a Database for the Application and a Dedicated Database User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block::sql

   CREATE DATABASE oro;
   CREATE USER 'oro_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@ssword123';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON oro.* to 'oro_user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Replace `oro_user` with a new username and `P@ssword123` with a more secure password. Ensure that the password contains
at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit, one special character, and has the total length of at
least 8 characters.

Configure Web Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the production mode, it is strongly recommended to use the HTTPS protocol for the Oro application public websites, and reserve the HTTP mode for development and testing purposes only.

The samples of Nginx configuration for HTTPS and HTTP mode are provided below. Update the
`/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` file with the content that matches the type of your environment.

* Replace **<application-root-folder>** with the absolute path where you are going to install the Oro application.
* Replace **<your-domain-name>** with the configured domain name that would be used for the Oro application.
* Change *ssl_certificate_key* and *ssl_certificate* with the actual values of your active SSL certificate.

Optionally, you can enable and configure |Apache PageSpeed module| for Nginx to improve
web page latency as described in the :ref:`Performance Optimization of the Oro Application Environment <installation--optimize-runtime-performance>` article.

.. note:: If you choose the Apache web server instead of Nginx one, the example of the web server configuration you can find in the :ref:`Web Server Configuration <installation--web-server-configuration>` article.

For the changes to take effect, restart `nginx` by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl restart nginx

Configure Domain Name Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are going to use the Oro application in the local environment only, modify the */etc/hosts* file on the server by adding the following line:

.. code-block:: none

   127.0.0.1 localhost <your-domain-name>

After this change, the <your-domain-name> URLs opened in the local environment are handled by the local webserver.

To make your Oro application accessible from the remote locations, configure a DNS server to point your domain name to your server IP address.

Configure PHP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure PHP, perform the following changes in the configuration files:

* In the `www.conf` file (*/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf*) --- Change the user and the group
  for PHP-FPM to *nginx* and set recommended values for other parameters.

  .. code-block:: none

     user = nginx
     group = nginx
     catch_workers_output = yes

* In the `php.ini` file (*/etc/php.ini*) --- Change the memory limit and cache configuration to the following:

  .. code-block:: none

     memory_limit = 1024M
     realpath_cache_size=4096K
     realpath_cache_ttl=600

* In the `opcache.ini` file (*/etc/php.d/10-opcache.ini*) --- Modify the OPcache parameter to match the following values:

  .. code-block:: none

     opcache.enable=1
     opcache.enable_cli=0
     opcache.memory_consumption=512
     opcache.interned_strings_buffer=32
     opcache.max_accelerated_files=32531
     opcache.save_comments=1

For the changes to take effect, restart PHP-FPM by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   systemctl restart php-fpm

Configure Storage For Import Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the import, product images and File entity field files can be imported by a path to an image or a file.

This path can be either:

- a URL,
- an absolute path,
- a relative path. In this case, the files are searched in the Gaufrette filesystem configured to store files to import. By default, it is configured to use the ``{PROJECT}/var/data/import_files`` local directory as storage.

This path can be reconfigured with |Gaufrette| adapter configuration.

For example, to change the path location, add a new configuration of the **import_files** |Gaufrette| adapter
in the `Resources/config/oro/app.yml` file of your bundle:

.. code-block:: yaml

    knp_gaufrette:
        adapters:
            import_files:
                local:
                    directory: '/new/path/to/import_files'

Use Gaufrette filesystem abstraction layer as storage, this configuration can be changed to use any supported filesystem
adapter supported by |Gaufrette| library.

For example, the configuration to use :ref:`GridFS <bundle-docs-platform-gridfs-config-bundle>` storage can be the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    knp_gaufrette:
        adapters:
            import_files:
                oro_gridfs:
                    mongodb_gridfs_dsn: 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/import_data_files'
