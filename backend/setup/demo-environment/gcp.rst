Google Cloud Platform
=====================

Google Cloud Platform enables you to deploy your Oro application instance in just one click without having to configure the software and settings manually.

The detailed guidance is provided further in this article.

Deploy the Solution
-------------------

1. Navigate to |Google Cloud Marketplace|, click **Explore Marketplace** and then search for your solution provided by Oro Inc.

2. Click **Launch on Compute Engine**.

3. The Oro solution deployment page displays the default settings (e.g., name, zone, machine type, boot disk type, networking interfaces, etc.). You can accept or customize them, if necessary.

4. You can also select the image version, with or without demo data. The application with demo data provides all the necessary information for you to test the application, such as a preconfigured list of customers, products, submitted orders, quotes, the structured master and web catalogs. You can also explore the storefront using one of the pre-configured demo user roles. Sign in either as a guest user, a buyer (use *BrandaJSanborn@example.org* both as your login and password), or a manager (use *AmandaRCole@example.org* both as your login and password).
