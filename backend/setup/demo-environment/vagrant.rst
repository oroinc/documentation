Vagrant Provision
=================

To get familiar with the application functionality, you can install Oro applications with
environment components using |Vagrant|.

Every Oro application has a *Vagrantfile* that enables you to set up a virtual machine with the Oro application via the
`vagrant up` command.

For example, to set up a VM with OroCommerce CE application v. 5.1.0 locally, run:

.. code-block:: none

    git clone -b 5.1.0 https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application.git oroapp && cd oroapp
    vagrant up

Once the command has run, you can access the application via the ``http://localhost.dev.oroinc.com:8000/`` URL.

The environment in the resulting VM and the provisioning steps in the Vagrantfile replicate the process described in the :ref:`Setup Application Environment Guide <dev-guide-development-practice-setup-dev-env-setup-env>` and the :ref:`Installation Guide <installation>`.

For more details on preparing the virtual platform for the virtual machine, please see the `Installation and Configuration`_ section below.

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Windows, macOS, Linux, or any other OS supported by Virtualbox and Vagrant
* 4096M available RAM on your PC

Installation Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by installing the required software:

1. |Install VirtualBox|.
2. |Install Vagrant|.
3. |Install Git.|

When you have installed VirtualBox, Vagrant, and Git, do the following:

1. Get the Oro application source code:

   .. code-block:: none

      git clone -b 5.1.0 <oro_application_clone_url> oroapp && cd oroapp

   Replace the <oro_application_clone_url> with the repository URL for the necessary Oro application:

   .. csv-table::
      :widths: 20, 30

      "OroCommerce Community Edition","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application"
      "OroCommerce Community Edition for Germany","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application-de"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Edition","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-enterprise-application"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Edition for Germany","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-enterprise-application-de"
      "OroCommerce Enterprise Edition (without CRM)","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-enterprise-nocrm-application"
      "OroCRM Community Edition","https://github.com/oroinc/crm-application"
      "OroCRM Enterprise Edition","https://github.com/oroinc/crm-enterprise-application"
      "OroPlatform Community Edition","https://github.com/oroinc/platform-application"
      "OroCommerce Platform","https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce-platform-application"

   .. note:: You can download and unpack the archive with the Oro application source code instead of using the Git repository. For more information, please see :ref:`Get the Oro Application Source Code <installation--get-files>`.

2. Configure and run the virtual machine using Vagrant:

   For Community Editions of the Oro Applications run:

   .. code-block:: none

      vagrant up

   for the Enterprise Editions of Oro applications, specify the following environment variables:

   - **gittoken** - |Github token| use it to install Oro application dependencies
   - **licence** - Enterprise Licence key for your Oro Application
   - **licencestart** - Enterprise License Start Day key for your Oro Application. The value format is YYYY-MM-DD, f.e. 2022-02-24.

   for Linux bash example:

   .. code-block:: none

      gittoken=YourGithubToken licencestart=YourEnterpsiseLicenceKeyStartDay 2licence=YourEnterpsiseLicenceKey vagrant up

   for Windows PowerShell terminal example:

   .. code-block:: none

      $env:licence = "YourEnterpsiseLicenceKey"; $env:gittoken = "YourGithubToken"; vagrant up

   .. note:: At the first start, vagrant will ask you to install the required `vagrant-env` plugin. You must agree (press `Y`) and repeat the command `vagrant up`.

   Once the command execution is complete and the setup is finished, you can use the Oro application.

   .. note:: When you run `vagrant up` for the first time, the Oro application installation may take some time, as the following time-consuming provisioning steps happen:

             * InstallBaseSystem - Base Oracle Linux 8 box download. Upgrade and install docker and docker compose plugin
             * Build - Run composer install for the Oro application in docker. Create docker image
             * Install - Oro application installation; note that loading demo data takes extra time.
             * Deploy - Deploy application

      The total time for the environment to get up and running depends on multiple factors, such as internet connection speed, CPU frequency, etc. It usually takes from 1- to 15 minutes.

   .. note:: You can re-run all or one of the required steps. For example, if the application code has changed, then you need to restart 3 steps: - Build, Install, Deploy.

   .. code-block:: none

      vagrant provision --provision-with Build,Install,Deploy


Customize Installation Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To customize the default installation settings, add the required variables in `.env-build`.

**Application settings**

.. code-block:: none

   ORO_USER_NAME=admin
   ORO_USER_PASSWORD=admin
   ORO_USER_FIRSTNAME=John
   ORO_USER_LASTNAME=Doe
   ORO_USER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   ORO_SAMPLE_DATA=n                # y | n (whether to perform loading demo data during installation)
   ORO_ORGANIZATION_NAME=ORO
   ORO_LANGUAGE=en
   ORO_FORMATTING_CODE=en_US
   ORO_APP_DOMAIN=localhost.dev.oroinc.com

To customize the application hostname:

* Set the new ORO_APP_DOMAIN parameter value in the `.env-build` (e.g., `yourdomain.local`)
* Map the new hostname to the application host IP address in your local |hosts|  file, like in the following examples:

  .. code-block:: none

     192.168.56.10 yourdomain.local www.yourdomain.local

Now you can open the Oro application in a browser via the ``http://yourdomain.local/`` URL.

Running Multiple Virtual Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single host, ensure that every virtual instance uses a unique forwarded port. Before running an additional instance, modify its forwarded port in the *host* section of the *config.vm.network "forwarded_port"* setting in the Vagrant file. You can increment the value for every new virtual instance, e.g., **instance A** can have *config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8000* configuration, and **instance B** can have *config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8001*. Also you should change port in variable `ORO_WEBSOCKET_FRONTEND_DSN=//*:8000/ws` for websocket frontend.

Access the Installed Oro Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the VM setup has finished, you can access the application in your browser with the credentials defined by your installation configuration.

The default login details are:

* *Application Storefront URL*: ``http://localhost.dev.oroinc.com:8000/``
* *Application Admin UI URL*: ``http://localhost.dev.oroinc.com:8000/admin/``
* *Admin Login*: admin
* *Admin Password*: admin

If you have changed the application host, admin login, or password, please refer to the `.env-build` for these details.

Shared Working Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vagrant maps the working directory on your host machine to the */vagrant* directory in the virtual machine file system.
Once the VM is up, any changes to the files in the host working directory are applied to the */vagrant* directory in the virtual machine file system, and vice versa. To update the application, you need to run the provision steps Build, Install, Deploy again.

.. code-block:: none

      vagrant provision --provision-with Build,Install,Deploy


SSH Access to the Virtual Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to the virtual machine via SSH, run the following command in the working directory on your host machine:

.. code-block:: none

   vagrant ssh

You will be logged in to the virtual machine as *vagrant* user with *sudo* permission (you do not need a password to use the *sudo* command).

To configure SSH access to the virtual machine for the utilities that run on the host machine, like IDE, get the explicit SSH credentials by running the following command:

.. code-block:: none

   vagrant ssh-config


Vagrant Ð¡ommands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `vagrant up` -- Creates and configures the virtual machine according to the Vagrantfile. Unless `vagrant destroy` has been launched on consecutive runs, `vagrant up` powers on the virtual machine. The provisioning scripts run only once.

* `vagrant provision --provision-with Build,Install,Deploy` --  Run provisioning scripts defined in the Vagrantfile.

* `vagrant halt` -- Stops the virtual machine and saves the virtual machine image (without the current RAM state) to the host hard drive.

* `vagrant suspend` -- Stops the virtual machine and saves the virtual machine image and the current RAM state on the host hard drive.

* `vagrant resume` -- Resume the suspended virtual machine.

* `vagrant destroy` -- Destroys the virtual machine and frees the host machine's resources.

For more information, please see the |official Vagrant documentation|.
