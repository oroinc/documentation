Workflows
=========

In a business application, a ``workflow`` is a sequence of steps or rules applied to a process from its initiation to completion.
In Oro applications, workflows organize and direct usersâ€™ work, making them follow particular steps in a pre-defined order, or preventing them from performing actions that either contradict or conflict with the logical steps of a process.

A workflow ``step`` is a state of an entity record. It is represented by an instance of the ``Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Entity\WorkflowStep`` class.
The process of moving an entity from one step to another is called a ``transition``.

This guide explains and illustrates how to create workflows through configuration files, and provides details on workflow components and their translation.
