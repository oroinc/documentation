    use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
    use Oro\Bundle\ImportExportBundle\Event\StrategyEvent;

    class CustomImportExportSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface {
        public static function getSubscribedEvents()
        {
            return [
                StrategyEvent::PROCESS_BEFORE => 'beforeImportStrategy',
                StrategyEvent::PROCESS_AFTER => 'afterImportStrategy',
            ];
        }

        public function beforeImportStrategy(StrategyEvent $event)
        {
            //YOUR IMPLEMENTATION
        }

        public function afterImportStrategy(StrategyEvent $event)
        {
            //YOUR IMPLEMENTATION
