Import and Export
=================

OroImportExportBundle allows developers to enable UI for the application users to export entity records to files, import them back to the application, and configure the import/export options for entity fields in the entity management UI. Import/export capabilities in Oro applications are available for the most critical features where the daily operations generate high data load.
