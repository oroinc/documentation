Supervisord
===========

As you read before consumers can normally interrupt the message
procession by many reasons. In the all cases above the interrupted
consumer should be re-run. So you must keep running
``oro:message-queue:consume`` command and to do this best we advise you
to delegate this responsibility to
|Supervisord|. With next program
configuration supervisord keeps running four simultaneous instances of
``oro:message-queue:consume`` command and cares about relaunch if
instance has dead by any reason.
