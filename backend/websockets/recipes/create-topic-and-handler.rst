Create a Topic and a Handler for Publishing and Subscribing
===========================================================

As discussed in the section on :ref:`WebSockets Architecture <dev-guide-system-websockets-architecture>`, all messages in WebSocket communications in Oro applications are published in a particular topic. Clients can subscribe to messages in the topics that they are interested in.

It is called a PubSub pattern, and it is part of the architecture of the Web Application Message Protocol subprotocol of the WebSockets protocol. It is aimed at providing a standard to coordinate real-time messaging between program components in loosely-coupled architectures based on microservices.

OroSyncBundle provides a router as part of the WebSocket server that receives messages for topics from publishers and distributes the messages to subscribed clients.

If you decided to create a new topic for WebSocket messages in the Oro application, you have to perform two main tasks:

* Declare topic with its route.
* Create one or more handlers to serve events related to this topic.

Declare Topic and Its Routing
-----------------------------

In order to declare a route for the topic, create a **websocket_routing.yml** file in the **Resources/config/oro** directory of your bundle. Fill it in with the following contents:

.. code-block:: yaml


    oro_sync.ping:                      # unique machine name of your topic in format "%extension_alias%.topic_name"
        channel: 'oro/ping'             # url of your topic channel
        handler:
            callback: 'oro_sync.ping'   # machine name of topic handler

You can declare parameterized routes as well, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: yaml


    oro_email.event:
        channel: 'oro/email_event/{user_id}/{organization_id}'
        handler:
            callback: 'oro_email.event'
        requirements:
            user_id:
                pattern: '\d+' # regular expression
            organization_id:
                pattern: '\d+'

You will be able to get parameters using **getAttributes()** from *WampRequest* **$request** argument in your topic handler. You can find more information about routing in the documentation of
|GosWebSocketBundle|.

Create and Declare Topic Handlers
---------------------------------

Topic handler is called by the WebSocket server router whenever one of the following events occurs:

* Client has subscribed
* Client has unsubscribed
* Client has published a message

Each topic handler, according to its logic, decides what to do with the occurred event. For example, in **onSubscribe()**, we can decide whether to allow subscription, and in **onPublish()**, we can broadcast the given message either to all subscribers or just to a restricted list.

Topic handler must implement *Gos\\Bundle\\WebSocketBundle\\Topic\\TopicInterface* and be declared as a service with the **gos_web_socket.topic** tag, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: twig


    oro_sync.topic.websocket_ping:
        class: Oro\Bundle\SyncBundle\Topic\WebsocketPingTopic
        arguments:
            - 'oro_sync.ping'
            - '@logger'
            - '%oro_sync.websocket_ping.interval%'
        tags:
            - { name: gos_web_socket.topic }

The **getName()** method of the topic handler must return its machine name which is used in the **websocket_routing.yml** file for the **handler.callback** configuration option.

OroSyncBundle provides an abstract class *Oro\\Bundle\\SyncBundle\\Topic\\AbstractTopic* and two out-of-box implementations of topic handlers for common purposes:

* **Oro\\Bundle\\SyncBundle\\Topic\\BroadcastTopic** broadcasts every published message to all subscribers. It is required for simple topics like oro_sync.maintenance which just informs about maintenance mode activation.
* **Oro\\Bundle\\SyncBundle\\Topic\\SecuredTopic** checks if a client is allowed to subscribe to the topic. It broadcasts every published message to all subscribers. It is required for topics like oro_email.event which informs users about new emails.

Therefore, if your topic handler is not intended to contain complex logic, you can use existing handlers, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: twig


    oro_sync.topic.maintenance:
        class: Oro\Bundle\SyncBundle\Topic\BroadcastTopic
        arguments:
            - 'oro_sync.maintenance'
        tags:
            - { name: gos_web_socket.topic }

Subscribe to the Topic Messages
-------------------------------

To subscribe a **backend client** for the topic messages, you can create your own topic handler (as described in the section above) and use its **onPublish()** method to perform any necessary tasks when a message is published to the topic.

To subscribe a **frontend client** to and unsubscribe it from the topic, use the **subscribe** and **unsubscribe** methods of the **orosync/js/sync** component, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: javascript


    import sync from 'orosync/js/sync';

    sync.subscribe('oro/ping', () => {
        console.log('Received message from oro/ping topic');
    });
