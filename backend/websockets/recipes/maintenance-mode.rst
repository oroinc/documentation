Use Maintenance Mode Notifications in Oro Applications
======================================================

Another type of notifications in Oro application that uses WebSockets functionality 
to deliver messages to users quickly are maintenance notifications.

System administrator or developers can set the Oro application to maintenance mode 
to perform maintenance tasks.

To do this, execute the following command in the console:

.. code-block:: none

    lexik:maintenance:lock --env=prod

This prompts the site to switch to the maintenance mode. All new visitors will 
see a message informing that the website is in the maintenance mode. All users 
who had their pages open when the site switched to the maintenance mode will get 
a WebSocket message informing that the maintenance mode is on. The website will
show a flash message and disable all UI elements on the opened page.

To turn off the maintenance mode, run the following command:

.. code-block:: none

   php bin/console lexik:maintenance:unlock --env=prod
