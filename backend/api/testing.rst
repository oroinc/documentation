Testing REST API
================

To ensure that your REST API resources work properly, cover them with |functional tests|. To simplify the creation of the functional test for REST API resources that conforms to |JSON:API specification|, the |RestJsonApiTestCase| test case was created. The following table contains the list of the most valuable methods in this class:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Method","Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "request","Sends a REST API request."

If the request is a file name, the file should be located in the ``requests`` directory next to the PHP file that contains the test."
   "getResponseData","Converts the given response to an array that can be used to compare it with a response received from the server. The given response can be a path to a file that contains the response data or an array with the response data.

   "getApiBaseUrl","Returns the base URL for all REST API requests, e.g. ``http://localhost/api``."
   "appendEntityConfig","Appends a configuration of an entity. This method is helpful when you create a general functionality and need to test it for different configurations without creating a test entity for each of them. Please note that the configuration is restored after each test, and thus, you do not need to do it manually."

.. note:: By default, HATEOAS is disabled in functional tests, although it is enabled by default in production and API Sandbox. It was done to avoid cluttering up the tests with HATEOAS links. In case you want to enable HATEOAS for your test, use HTTP_HATEOAS server parameter, e.g. ``$this->cget(['entity' => 'products'], [], ['HTTP_HATEOAS' => true])``.

.. _api-batch-api:

Testing Batch API
-----------------

To simplify the creation of the functional test for REST Batch API resources that conforms to |JSON:API specification|,
the |RestJsonApiUpdateListTestCase| test case was created. The following table contains the list of the most valuable
methods in this class:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Method","Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "processUpdateList","Sends PATCH request for a list of entities (see :ref:`update_list <update-list-action>` action) and executes all message queue processors required to process Batch API operation."

Example of a functional test for Batch API:

.. code-block:: php

    public function testCreateEntities()
    {
        $this->processUpdateList(
            Lead::class,
            [
                'data' => [
                    [
                        'type'       => 'leads',
                        'attributes' => ['name' => 'New Lead 1']
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        );

        $response = $this->cget(['entity' => 'leads'], ['fields[leads]' => 'name']);
        $responseContent = $this->updateResponseContent(
            [
                'data' => [
                    [
                        'type'       => 'leads',
                        'id'         => '<toString(@lead1->id)>',
                        'attributes' => ['name' => 'Existing Lead 1']
                    ],
                    [
                        'type'       => 'leads',
                        'id'         => 'new',
                        'attributes' => ['name' => 'New Lead 1']
                    ]
                ]
            ],
            $response
        );
        $this->assertResponseContains($responseContent, $response);
    }

.. _api-load-fixtures:

Load Fixtures
-------------

You can use :ref:`Doctrine and Alice fixtures <automated-test>`:

.. code-block:: php

    class InventoryLevelApiTest extends RestJsonApiTestCase
    {
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        protected function setUp()
        {
            parent::setUp();
            $this->loadFixtures([__DIR__ . '/DataFixtures/inventory_level.yml']);
        }

Fixture file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    dependencies:
      - Oro\Bundle\WarehouseBundle\Tests\Functional\DataFixtures\LoadWarehouseAndInventoryLevels

    Oro\Bundle\InventoryBundle\Entity\InventoryLevel:
      warehouse_inventory_level.warehouse.1.product_unit_precision.product-1.primary_unit:
        warehouse: '@warehouse.1'
        productUnitPrecision: '@product-1->primaryUnitPrecision'
        quantity: 10

You can use the ``dependencies`` section if a fixture depends on another Doctrine or Alice fixtures. References are shared between Alice and Doctrine fixtures.

.. _api-alice-references:

Alice References
----------------

You can use references in Alice fixtures:

::

    @product-1

Use methods of properties with references:

::

    @product-2->createdAt->format("Y-m-d\TH:i:s\Z")

.. _yaml-templates:

YAML Templates
--------------

A YAML template is a regular YAML file. The only difference is that you can use references and fakers in values. They will be processed by Alice and replaced with the appropriate real values. For details, see the |Alice documentation|.

.. _assert-expectations:

Assert the Expectations
-----------------------

Assert the expected response by using YAML templates.

A YAML template:

.. code-block:: yaml

    data:
        -
            type: inventorylevels
            id: '@warehouse_inventory_level.warehouse.1.product_unit_precision.product-1.liter->id'
            attributes:
                quantity: '10'
            relationships:
                product:
                    data:
                        type: products
                        id: '@product-1->id'
                productUnitPrecision:
                    data:
                        type: productunitprecisions
                        id: '@product_unit_precision.product-1.liter->id'
                warehouse:
                    data:
                        type: warehouses
                        id: '@warehouse.1->id'

In php test:

.. code-block:: php

    public function testGetList()
    {
        $response = $this->cget(
            ['entity' => 'inventorylevels'],
            [
                'include' => 'product,productUnitPrecision',
                'filter' => [
                    'product.sku' => '@product-1->sku',
                ]
            ]
        );

        $this->assertResponseContains('cget_filter_by_product.yml', $response);
    }

.. _yaml-templates-for-request-body:

YAML Templates for a Request Body
---------------------------------

You can use an array with references for a request body:

.. code-block:: php

    public function testUpdateEntity()
    {
        $response = $this->patch(
            ['entity' => 'inventorylevels', 'product.sku' => '@product-1->sku'],
            [
                'data' => [
                    'type' => 'inventorylevels',
                    'id' => '<toString(@product-1->id)>',
                    'attributes' => [
                        'quantity' => '17'
                    ]
                ],
            ]
        );
    }

Alternatively, you can store YAML in a ``.yml`` file:

.. code-block:: php

    public function testCreateCustomer()
    {
        $this->post(
            ['entity' => 'customers'],
            'create_customer.yml' // loads data from __DIR__ . '/requests/create_customer.yml'
        );
    }

.. _process-single-reference:

Process Single Reference
------------------------

To process a single reference, for example, to compare it with another value:

.. code-block:: php

    self::processTemplateData('@inventory_level.product_unit_precision.product-1.liter->quantity')

The ``processTemplateData`` method can process a string, an array, or a YAML file.

.. _dump-response-into-yaml-template:

Dump the Response into a YAML Template
--------------------------------------

When you develop new tests for REST API, it may be convenient to dump responses into a YAML template:

.. code-block:: php

    public function testGetList()
    {
        $response = $this->cget(
            ['entity' => 'products'],
            ['filter' => ['sku' => '@product-1->sku']]
        );
        // dumps response content to __DIR__ . '/responses/' . 'test_cget_entity.yml'
        $this->dumpYmlTemplate('test_cget_entity.yml', $response);
    }

.. important:: Do not forget to check references after you dump a response for the first time: there can be collisions if references have the same IDs.

Base Test Cases for Unit Tests
------------------------------

To simplify |unit testing| of :ref:`API processors <web-api--processors>`, you can use one of the following base classes:

.. csv-table::
