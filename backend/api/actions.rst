.. _web-api--actions:

Actions
=======

The action is a set of processors that handle a request.

Each action has two required elements:

-  **context** -  An object that stores the input and output data and shares data between processors.
-  **main processor** - The main entry point for an action. This class is responsible for creating the context and executing all worker processors.

For more details about these elements, see the `Creating a New Action`_ section.

The following table shows all actions provided out-of-the-box:

.. _delete-list-action:

delete_list Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action deletes a list of entities.

The entities list is built based on input filters. You must specify at least one filter, otherwise, you will get an error.

By default, the maximum number of entities that can be deleted by one request is 100, see the ``max_delete_entities`` option in :ref:`General Configuration <web-api--configuration-general>`. This limit minimizes the impact on the server. You can change this limit for an entity in `Resources/config/oro/api.yml` but test it carefully as a higher limit can significantly impact the server. See an example of changing the default limit in the :ref:`How To <max-number-of-entities-to-be-deleted>` topic.

.. _web-api--auxiliary-actions:

Auxiliary Actions
-----------------

.. _customize-loaded-data-action:

customize_loaded_data Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action makes modifications to the data loaded by the `get <#get-action>`__, `get_list <#get-list-action>`__ and `get_subresource <#get-subresource-action>`__ actions.

The context class: |CustomizeLoadedDataContext|.

The main processor class: |CustomizeLoadedDataProcessor|.

An example of a processor used to modify the loaded data is |ComputePrimaryField| or :ref:`Add a Computed Field <add-computed-field>`. Run ``php bin/console oro:api:debug customize_loaded_data`` to display other processors registered in this action.

The ``collection`` tag attribute can be used for processors of this action to process all primary entities in `get_list <#get-list-action>`__ or `get_subresource <#get-subresource-action>`__ actions or all entities in ``to-many`` associations for `get <#get-action>`__, `get_list <#get-list-action>`__ or `get_subresource <#get-subresource-action>`__ actions. An example of a case when using this attribute can be helpful if you want to execute one SQL query for all entities in a collection to get additional data instead of executing a separate SQL query for each entity in a collection. The default value the ``collection`` tag attribute is ``false``. An example of a processor that should be executed to a whole collection:

.. code-block:: php

    services:
        acme.api.process_my_collection:
            class: Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Api\Processor\ProcessMyCollection
            tags:
                - { name: oro.api.processor, action: customize_loaded_data, collection: true, class: Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Entity\MyEntity }

.. important:: The collection elements are an associative array, and processors responsible for customizing the collection must keep keys in this array without changes.

.. note:: All processors for this action have the ``identifier_only`` tag attribute set to ``false``. It means that such processors are not executed when loading relationships. If your processor should be executed when loading the relationships, set the ``identifier_only`` tag attribute to ``true``. If your processor should be executed when loading relationships, primary, and included entities, set the ``identifier_only`` tag attribute to ``null``. For example:

    .. code-block:: php

        services:
            acme.api.compute_my_field:
                class: Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Api\Processor\ComputeMyField
                tags:
                    - { name: oro.api.processor, action: customize_loaded_data, identifier_only: true, class: Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Entity\MyEntity }

.. note:: The ``identifier_only`` tag attribute is not supported if the ``collection`` tag attribute equals ``true``. All processors intended to modify collections are executed when loading primary entities and entities in to-many associations, even if only the identifier field is requested.

.. note:: The |ValueTransformer| can be used in ``customize_loaded_data`` processors to convert a value to a format suitable for the API response.

.. _customize-form-data-action:

customize_form_data Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Makes modification and validation of submitted data, and entities to be persisted in the database by
the `create <#create-action>`__, `update <#update-action>`__, `update_relationship <#update_relationship-action>`__,
`add_relationship <#add_relationship-action>`__ and `delete_relationship <#delete_relationship-action>`__ actions.

The context class: |CustomizeFormDataContext|.

The main processor class: |CustomizeFormDataProcessor|.

This action is executed when the following |ApiEvents| are dispatched:

.. csv-table::
    :header: "Event Name","Description"
    :widths: 15, 30

    "pre_submit","This event is dispatched at the beginning of the Form::submit() method."
    "submit","This event is dispatched after the Form::submit() method has submitted and mapped the children, and after reverse transformation to normalized representation."
    "post_submit","This event is dispatched at the very end of the Form::submit()."
    "pre_validate","This event is dispatched at the end of the form submitting process, just before data validation. It can be used to final form data correcting after all listeners, except data validation listener, are executed and all relationships between submitted data are set."
    "post_validate","This event is dispatched at the end of the form submitting process, just after data validation. It can be used to finalize the form after all listeners, including the data validation listener, are executed. E.g. it can be used to correct form validation result."
    "pre_flush_data","This event is dispatched after the database transaction is open but before data are flushed into the database."
    "post_flush_data","This event is dispatched after data are successfully flushed into the database but before the database transaction is committed."
    "post_save_data","This event is dispatched after data are successfully flushed into the database, and the database transaction is committed. It can be used to perform some not crucial operations after data are saved into the database. It means that failure of these operations will not roll back data saved into the database."

.. note:: All these events use the same context, so it can be used to share data between events.

.. note:: When a request contains :ref:`included entities <web-services-api--create-update-related-resources>`, these events are dispatched for the included entities first and then for the primary entity. Each entity has its own context. Use the **getSharedData()** method of the `Context <#context-class>`__ class to share data between events for different entities.

An example of a processor used to modify the submitted data is |MapPrimaryField|. You can also run ``php bin/console oro:api:debug customize_form_data`` to display other processors registered in this action.

.. _web-api--actions-create:

Creating a New Action
---------------------

To create a new action, to create two classes:

-  **context** - This class represents a context in the scope of which an action is executed. An instance of this class is used to store the input and output data and share data between processors. This class must extend |ApiContext|. Depending on your needs, you can use another classes derived from |ApiContext|, for example |Context|, |SingleItemContext| or |ListContext|.
-  **main processor** - This class is the main entry point for an action and is responsible for creating an instance of the context class and executing all worker processors. This class must extend |ActionProcessor| and implement the ``createContextObject`` method. Depending on your needs, you can use other classes derived from |ActionProcessor|, for example, |NormalizeResultActionProcessor|.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Api\Processor;

    use Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Processor\ApiContext;

    class MyActionContext extends ApiContext
    {
    }

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Api\Processor;

    use Oro\Component\ChainProcessor\ActionProcessor;

    class MyActionProcessor extends ActionProcessor
    {
        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        protected function createContextObject(): MyActionContext
        {
            return new MyActionContext();
        }
    }

Additionally, you need to register your processor in the dependency injection container:

.. code-block:: yaml

    acme.my_action.processor:
        class: Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Api\Processor\MyActionProcessor
        public: false
        arguments:
            - '@oro_api.processor_bag'
            - my_action # the name of an action

If you need to create groups for your action, register them in the ApiBundle configuration. To do this, add `Resources/config/oro/app.yml` to your bundle, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    oro_api:
        actions:
            my_action:
                processing_groups:
                    initialize:
                        priority: -10
                    load_data:
                        priority: -20
                    finalize:
                        priority: -30

.. note:: The ``priority`` attribute is used to control the order in which groups of processors are executed. The higher the priority, the earlier a group of processors is executed. The default value is 0. The possible range is from -254 to 252. For details on processor creation, see the :ref:`Processors <web-api--processors>` section.
