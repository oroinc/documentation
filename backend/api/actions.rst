.. _web-api--actions:

Actions
=======

The action is a set of processors that handle a request.

Each action has two required elements:

-  **context** -  An object that is used to store the input and output data and share data between processors.
-  **main processor** - The main entry point for an action. This class is responsible for creating the context and executing all of the worker processors.

For more details about these elements, see the `Creating a New Action`_ section.

The following table shows all actions provided out-of-the-box:

.. _delete-list-action:

delete\_list Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action deletes a list of entities.

The entities list is built based on input filters. Please take into account that at least one filter must be specified. Otherwise, an error raises.

By default, the maximum number of entities that can be deleted by one request is 100, see the ``max_delete_entities`` option in :ref:`General Configuration <web-api--configuration-general>`. This limit was introduced to minimize the impact on the server. You can change this limit for an entity in `Resources/config/oro/api.yml`. However, please test your limit carefully because a higher limit may make a more significant impact on the server. An example of how to change the default limit is available in the :ref:`How To <max-number-of-entities-to-be-deleted>` topic.

.. _web-api--auxiliary-actions:

Auxiliary Actions
-----------------

.. _customize-loaded-data-action:

customize\_loaded\_data Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action makes modifications to the data loaded by the `get <#get-action>`__, `get_list <#get-list-action>`__ and `get_subresource <#get-subresource-action>`__ actions.

The context class: |CustomizeLoadedDataContext|.

The main processor class: |CustomizeLoadedDataProcessor|.

As example of a processor used to modify the loaded data: |ComputePrimaryField| or :ref:`Add a Computed Field <add-computed-field>`. Run ``php bin/console oro:api:debug customize_loaded_data`` to display other processors registered in this action.

The ``collection`` tag attribute can be used for processors of this action to process all primary entities in `get_list <#get-list-action>`__ or `get_subresource <#get-subresource-action>`__ actions or all entities in ``to-many`` associations for `get <#get-action>`__, `get_list <#get-list-action>`__ or `get_subresource <#get-subresource-action>`__ actions. An example of a case when using of this attribute can be helpful is if you want to execute one SQL query for all entities in a collection to get an additional data instead of executing a separate SQL query for each entity in a collection. The default value the ``collection`` tag attribute is ``false``. An example of a processor that should be executed to a whole collection:

.. code-block:: php

   services:
    acme.api.process_my_collection:
        class: Acme\Bundle\AppBundle\Api\Processor\ProcessMyCollection
        tags:
            - { name: oro.api.processor, action: customize_loaded_data, collection: true, class: Acme\Bundle\AppBundle\Entity\MyEntity }

.. important:: The collection elements are an associative array and processors responsible to customize the collection must keep keys in this array without changes.

Note: All processors for this action has ``identifier_only`` tag attribute set to ``false``. It means that such processors are not executed when loading of relationships. If your processor should be executed when loading of relationships set ``identifier_only`` tag attribute to ``true``. If your processor should be executed when loading of relationships, primary and included entities, set ``identifier_only`` tag attribute to ``null``. E.g.:

.. code-block:: php

   services:
    acme.api.compute_my_field:
        class: Acme\Bundle\AppBundle\Api\Processor\ComputeMyField
        tags:
            - { name: oro.api.processor, action: customize_loaded_data, identifier_only: true, class: Acme\Bundle\AppBundle\Entity\MyEntity }


.. note:: The ``identifier_only`` tag attribute is not supported if the ``collection`` tag attribute equals ``true``. All processors intended for the modification of collections are executed when loading primary entities and entities in to-many associations, even if only identifier field is requested.

.. note:: The |ValueTransformer| can be used in ``customize_loaded_data`` processors to convert a value
          to a format suitable for the API response.

.. _customize-form-data-action:

customize\_form\_data Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This action makes modifications of the submitted form data for the `create <#create-action>`__ and `update <#update-action>`__ actions.

The context class: |CustomizeFormDataContext|.

The main processor class: |CustomizeFormDataProcessor|.

This action is executed when the following |ApiEvents| are dispatched:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Event Name","Description"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "pre_submit","This event is dispatched at the beginning of the Form::submit() method."
   "submit","This event is dispatched just before the Form::submit() method."
   "post_submit","This event is dispatched after the Form::submit() method."
   "pre_validate","This event is dispatched at the end of the form submitting process, just before data validation. It can be used to final form data correcting after all listeners, except data validation listener, are executed and all relationships between submitted data are set."
   "post_validate","This event is dispatched at the end of the form submitting process, just after data validation. It can be used to finalize the form after all listeners, including data validation listener, are executed. E.g. it can be used to correct form validation result."

Please note the all these events use the same context, so it can be used to share data between events.

As example of a processor used to modify the loaded data: |MapPrimaryField|. Also you can run ``php bin/console oro:api:debug customize_form_data`` to display other processors registered in this action.

Additionally, |ValueNormalizer| and |ValueNormalizerUtil| were created to make usage of this action as easy as possible.

Example:

.. code-block:: php

    /** @var ValueNormalizer $valueNormalizer */
    $valueNormalizer = $container->get('oro_api.metadata_provider');
    $normalizedValue = $valueNormalizer->normalizeValue($value, $dataType, $requestType);

.. _web-api--actions-create:

Creating a New Action
---------------------

To create a new action you need to create two classes:

-  **context** - This class represents an context in scope of which an action is executed. An instance of this class is used to store the input and output data and share data between processors. This class must extend |ApiContext|. Depending on your needs, you can use another classes derived from |ApiContext|, for example |Context|, |SingleItemContext| or |ListContext|.
-  **main processor** - This class is the main entry point for an action and responsible for creating an instance of the context class and executing all worker processors. This class must extend |ActionProcessor| and implement the ``createContextObject`` method. Depending on your needs, you can use another classes derived from |ActionProcessor|, for example |NormalizeResultActionProcessor|.

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Api\Processor;

    use Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Processor\ApiContext;

    class MyActionContext extends ApiContext
    {
    }

.. code-block:: php

    namespace Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Api\Processor;

    use Oro\Component\ChainProcessor\ActionProcessor;

    class MyActionProcessor extends ActionProcessor
    {
        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        protected function createContextObject()
        {
            return new MyActionContext();
        }
    }

Additionally, you need to register your processor in the dependency injection container:

.. code-block:: yaml

        acme.my_action.processor:
            class: Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Api\Processor\MyActionProcessor
            public: false
            arguments:
                - '@oro_api.processor_bag'
                - my_action # the name of an action

If you need to create groups for your action, register them in the ApiBundle configuration. To do this, add `Resources/config/oro/app.yml` to your bundle, for example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    oro_api:
        actions:
            my_action:
                processing_groups:
                    initialize:
                        priority: -10
                    load_data:
                        priority: -20
                    finalize:
                        priority: -30

Please note that the ``priority`` attribute is used to control the order in which groups of processors are executed. The higher the priority, the earlier a group of processors is executed. Default value is 0. The possible range is from -254 to 252. For details on processor creation, see the :ref:`Processors <web-api--processors>` section.
