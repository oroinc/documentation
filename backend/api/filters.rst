Filters
=======

This chapter provides information on the existing filters and illustrates how to create new filters.

Filters are used to limit a set of data or request additional information returned by the API.

Filters for fields that have a database index are enabled automatically. Filters by all other fields should be
:ref:`enabled explicitly <filters-config>`.

.. _comparisonfilter-filter:

ComparisonFilter Filter
-----------------------

The |ComparisonFilter| is the default filter used to filter data by a field value
using various comparison types.

All supported comparison types are listed in the following table:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Comparison Type","Operator","Description"
   :widths: 15, 15, 30

   "eq","`=`","For fields and not collection valued associations, it checks whether a field value is equal to a filter value. For collection valued associations, it checks whether a collection contains any of the filter values."
   "neq ","`!=`","For fields and not collection valued associations, it checks whether a field value is not equal to a filter value. For collection valued associations, it checks that a collection does not contain any filter values. Records with `null` as the field value or an empty collection are not returned. To return them, use the `neq_or_null` comparison type."
   "lt","`<`","Checks whether a field value is less than a filter value. Supports numeric, date, and time fields."
   "lte","`<=`","Checks whether a field value is less than or equal to a filter value. Supports numeric, date, and time fields."
   "gt","`>`","Checks whether a field value is greater than a filter value. Supports numeric, date, and time fields."
   "gte","`>=`","Checks whether a field value is greater than or equal to a filter value. Supports numeric, date, and time fields."
   "exists","`*`","For fields and not collection valued associations, it checks whether a field value is not `null` (if a filter value is `true`) or a field value is `null` (if a filter value is `false`). For collection valued associations, it checks whether a collection is not empty (if a filter value is `true`) or empty (if a filter value is `false`)."
   "neq_or_null","`!*`","For fields and not collection valued associations checks whether a field value is not equal to a filter value, or is `null`. For collection valued associations, it  checks whether a collection does not contain any filter values or is empty."
   "contains","`~`","For string fields, it checks whether a field value contains a filter value. The `LIKE '%value%'` comparison is used. For collection valued associations, it checks whether a collection contains all of the filter values."
   "not_contains","`!~`","For string fields, it checks that a field value does not contain a filter value. The `NOT LIKE '%value%'` comparison is used. For collection valued associations, it checks that a collection does not contain all of the filter values."
   "starts_with","`^`","Checks whether a field value starts with a filter value. The `LIKE 'value%'` comparison is used. Supports only string fields."
   "not_starts_with","`!^`","Checks that a field value does not start with a filter value. The `NOT LIKE 'value%'` comparison is used. Supports only string fields. "
   "ends_with","`$`","Checks whether a field value ends with a filter value. The `LIKE '%value'` comparison is used. Supports only string fields."
   "not_ends_with","`!$`","Checks that a field value does not end with a filter value. The `NOT LIKE '%value'` comparison is used. Supports only string fields."

Existing Filters
----------------

A list of filters that are configured automatically according to the data type of a field:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Data Type / Filter Type","Operators enabled by default"
   :widths: 15, 30

   "string","`=`, `!=`, `*`, `!*`"
   "boolean","`=`, `!=`, `*`, `!*`"
   "integer","`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `*`, `!*`"

   "currency","`=`, `!=`, `*`, `!*`"
   "duration","`=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `*`, `!*`"

All these filters are implemented by :ref:`ComparisonFilter <comparisonfilter-filter>`.

See :ref:`Enable Advanced Operators for String Filter <advanced-operators-for-string-filter>` and :ref:`Enable Case-insensitive String Filter <case-insensitive-string-filter>` for examples of advanced filter configuration.

The following filters are also configured automatically:

- The `composite_identifier` filter for the ID field if an entity has a composite identifier.
  The operators enabled for this filter are `=`, `!=`.
  It is implemented by |CompositeIdentifierFilter|.
- The `association_composite_identifier` filter for the ID field if an association has a composite identifier.
  The operators enabled for this filter are `=`, `!=`.
  It is implemented by |AssociationCompositeIdentifierFilter|.
- The `association` filter for :ref:`multi-target associations <book-entities-extended-entities-multi-target-associations>`.
  The operators enabled for this filter are `=`, `!=`, `*`, `!*`.
  It is implemented by |ExtendedAssociationFilter|.
  More details on how to configure multi-target associations are available in the following topics:
  :ref:`Configure an Extended Many-To-One Association <extended-many-to-one-association>`,
  :ref:`Configure an Extended Many-To-Many Association <extended-many-to-many-association>` and
  :ref:`Configure an Extended Multiple Many-To-One Association <extended-multiple-many-to-one-association>`.

A list of filters that should be configured explicitly using the :ref:`type <filters-config>` option:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Filter Type","Enabled Operators","Implemented by"
   :widths: 15, 30, 30

   "primaryField","`=`, `!=`, `*`, `!*`","|PrimaryFieldFilter|"
   "nestedTree","`>`, `>=`","|NestedTreeFilter| "
   "searchQuery","`=`","|SearchQueryFilter|"
   "searchAggregation","`=`","|SearchAggregationFilter|"

You can also run the `php var/console debug:config oro_api` command to view all the existing filters
in the  `filters` section and all the existing operators for filters in the `filter_operators` section.

.. _web-api--filterinterface:

FilterInterface Interface
-------------------------

All filters must implement the |FilterInterface| interface.

Consider checking out the following classes before implementing your own filters, as each of them may serve as a good base class for your own filters:

* :ref:`StandaloneFilter <standalonefilter-base-class>`
* :ref:`StandaloneFilterWithDefaultValue <standalonefilterwithdefaultvalue-base-class>`,
* :ref:`ComparisonFilter <comparisonfilter-filter>` and
* |AssociationFilter|

.. _fieldfilterinterface:

FieldFilterInterface Interface
------------------------------

The |FieldFilterInterface| is a marker interface that filters applied to a field must implement.

Examples of such filters are :ref:`ComparisonFilter <comparisonfilter-filter>`, |CompositeIdentifierFilter|, |AssociationCompositeIdentifierFilter|, |NestedTreeFilter|, |ExtendedAssociationFilter| and |PrimaryFieldFilter|.

.. _fieldawarefilterinterface:

FieldAwareFilterInterface Interface
-----------------------------------

Filters that are applied to a field and need to know the field name. must implement the |FieldAwareFilterInterface| interface.

Examples of such filters are :ref:`ComparisonFilter <comparisonfilter-filter>`, |ExtendedAssociationFilter|, |PrimaryFieldFilter| and |AssociationCompositeIdentifierFilter|.

.. _collectionawarefilterinterface:

CollectionAwareFilterInterface Interface
----------------------------------------

Filters that can handle a collection valued association must implement the |CollectionAwareFilterInterface| interface.

Examples of such filters are :ref:`ComparisonFilter <comparisonfilter-filter>`, |ExtendedAssociationFilter| and |PrimaryFieldFilter|.

.. _configawarefilterinterface:

ConfigAwareFilterInterface Interface
------------------------------------

Filters that depend on the |entity configuration| must implement the |ConfigAwareFilterInterface| interface.

.. _metaawarefilterinterface:

MetadataAwareFilterInterface Interface
--------------------------------------

Filters that depend on the |entity metadata| must implement the |MetadataAwareFilterInterface| interface.
An example of such a filter is |CompositeIdentifierFilter| and |AssociationCompositeIdentifierFilter|.

.. _requestawarefilterinterface:

RequestAwareFilterInterface Interface
-------------------------------------

Filters that depend on a :ref:`request type <api-request-type>` must implement the |RequestAwareFilterInterface| interface.

Examples of such filters are |ExtendedAssociationFilter|, |CompositeIdentifierFilter| and |AssociationCompositeIdentifierFilter|.

.. _selfidentifiablefilterinterface:

SelfIdentifiableFilterInterface Interface
-----------------------------------------

Filters that should search for their value themselves must implement the |SelfIdentifiableFilterInterface| interface.

An example of such a filter is |ExtendedAssociationFilter|.

.. _namedvaluefilterinterface:

NamedValueFilterInterface Interface
-----------------------------------

Filters with a named value should implement the |NamedValueFilterInterface| interface.

An example of such a filter is |ExtendedAssociationFilter|.

.. _specialhandlingfilterinterface:

SpecialHandlingFilterInterface Interface
----------------------------------------

Filters with special handling must implement the |SpecialHandlingFilterInterface| interface. As a result, common normalization should not be applied to their values.

Examples of such a filter are |MetaPropertyFilter|, |FieldsFilter|, and |IncludeFilter|.

.. _standalonefilter-base-class:

StandaloneFilter Base Class
---------------------------

The |StandaloneFilter| is the base class for filters you can use independently of other filters.

Examples of such filters are:

* :ref:`ComparisonFilter <comparisonfilter-filter>`
* |ExtendedAssociationFilter|
* |CompositeIdentifierFilter|
* |AssociationCompositeIdentifierFilter|
* |NestedTreeFilter|
* |SearchQueryFilter|
* |SearchAggregationFilter|
* |SimpleSearchFilter|
* |PrimaryFieldFilter|

.. _standalonefilterwithdefaultvalue-base-class:

StandaloneFilterWithDefaultValue Base Class
-------------------------------------------

The |StandaloneFilterWithDefaultValue| is the base class for filters
that you can use independently of other filters and have a predefined default value.

Examples of such filters are |PageNumberFilter|, |PageSizeFilter|  and |SortFilter|.

Criteria Class
--------------

The |Criteria| class represents criteria for filtering data returned by ORM queries.
This class extends the |Doctrine Criteria| class and adds methods to work with joins.
It is required as API filters can be applied to associations at any nesting level.

CriteriaConnector Class
-----------------------

The |CriteriaConnector| class is used to apply criteria stored in the Criteria object to the QueryBuilder object.

This class uses |CriteriaNormalizer| to prepare the Criteria object before criteria are applied to the QueryBuilder object.

Keep in mind that you can decorate |RequireJoinsDecisionMakerInterface| and |OptimizeJoinsDecisionMakerInterface| interfaces
and `oro_api.query.require_joins_decision_maker` and `oro_api.query.optimize_joins_decision_maker` services if your expressions require this.


QueryExpressionVisitor Class
----------------------------

The |QueryExpressionVisitor| is used to walk a graph of DQL expressions from the Criteria object and turns them into a query. This class is similar to
|Doctrine QueryExpressionVisitor|, but allows adding new types of expressions easily and helps to build subquery-based expressions.

.. _web-api--query-expressions:

Query Expressions
-----------------

The following query expressions are implemented out-of-the-box:


.. csv-table::
   :header: "Operator","Class","Description"
   :widths: 15, 30, 30

    "AND","|AndCompositeExpression|","Logical AND"
    "OR","|OrCompositeExpression|","Logical OR"
    "NOT","|NotCompositeExpression|","Logical NOT"
    "=","|EqComparisonExpression|","EQUAL TO comparison"
    "<>","|NeqComparisonExpression|","NOT EQUAL TO comparison"
    "<","|LtComparisonExpression|","LESS THAN comparison"
    "<=","|LteComparisonExpression|","LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO comparison"
    ">","|GtComparisonExpression|","GREATER THAN comparison"
    ">=","|GteComparisonExpression|","GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO comparison"
    "IN","|InComparisonExpression|","IN comparison"
    "NIN","|NinComparisonExpression|","NOT IN comparison"
    "EXISTS","|ExistsComparisonExpression|","EXISTS (IS NOT NULL) and DOES NOT EXIST (IS NULL) comparisons"
    "EMPTY","|EmptyComparisonExpression|","EMPTY and NOT EMPTY comparisons for collections"
    "NEQ_OR_NULL","|NeqOrNullComparisonExpression|","NOT EQUAL TO OR IS NULL comparison"
    "NEQ_OR_EMPTY","|NeqOrEmptyComparisonExpression|","NOT EQUAL TO OR EMPTY comparison for collections"
    "MEMBER_OF","|MemberOfComparisonExpression|","checks whether a collection contains any of specific values"
    "ALL_MEMBER_OF","|AllMemberOfComparisonExpression|","checks whether a collection contains all of specific values"
    "ALL_NOT_MEMBER_OF","|AllMemberOfComparisonExpression|","checks whether a collection does not contain all of specific values"
    "CONTAINS","|ContainsComparisonExpression|","LIKE ``%value%`` comparison"
    "NOT_CONTAINS","|NotContainsComparisonExpression|","NOT LIKE ``%value%`` comparison"
    "STARTS_WITH","|StartsWithComparisonExpression|","LIKE ``value%`` comparison"
    "NOT_STARTS_WITH","|NotStartsWithComparisonExpression|","NOT LIKE ``value%`` comparison"
    "ENDS_WITH","|EndsWithComparisonExpression|","LIKE ``%value`` comparison"
    "NOT_ENDS_WITH","|NotEndsWithComparisonExpression|","NOT LIKE ``%value`` comparison"
    "NESTED_TREE","|NestedTreeComparisonExpression|","returns all child nodes for a given node depending on the nesting level"
    "NESTED_TREE_WITH_ROOT","|NestedTreeComparisonExpression|","returns a given node and all child nodes for this node depending on the nesting level"

You can add new comparison expressions and use them in your filters if necessary. For this, create a class that implements the expression logic, register it as a service tagged with the `oro.api.query.comparison_expression` in the dependency injection container, and decorate the |oro_api.query.require_joins_decision_maker|
and |oro_api.query.optimize_joins_decision_maker| services if required.

.. _web-api--creating-filter:

Creating a New Filter
---------------------

To create a new filter:

* Create a class that implements the filtering logic. This class must implement `FilterInterface Interface`_ or extend one of the classes implementing this interface.
* If your filter is complex and depends on other services, create a factory to create the filter.
  Register the factory as a service in the dependency injection container.
* Register this class in the `oro_api / filters` section using `Resources/config/oro/app.yml`.
  You can find examples of filters registration in
  |api app.yml|.

To configure your filter for an API resource, use the :ref:`type <filters-config>` option of the filter.
