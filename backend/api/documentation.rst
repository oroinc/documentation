Documenting API Resources
=========================

Documentation is an important part of API and helps developers to use your API. Therefore, it is necessary to provide detailed documentation for your API resources.

OroPlatform collects documentation for API resources from several sources:

-  The documentation can be written in a :ref:`configuration file <web-api--configuration>`.
-  A |Markdown1| document. The detailed information you can find bellow in this document.
-  System-wide descriptions of |configurable entities and fields|.

The source with the highest priority is the configuration file. The documentation provided there overrides all other sources. However, it is a YAML file and therefore, it is not fully suitable for big multi-line texts. The more appropriate place for the documentation is a separate |Markdown1|  file. To use a custom markdown file, provide a link to it in the configuration file, e.g.:

.. code-block:: yaml

    api:
        entities:
            Acme\Bundle\AppBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
                documentation_resource: '@AcmeAppBundle/Resources/doc/api/acme_entity.md'

If the documentation was not found neither the configuration file nor in the Markdown documentation file, OroPlatform tries to use system-wide descriptions of entities and fields. These descriptions are usually provided in translation files. This is the best way to document fields because the descriptions can be used in other places, not only in API. Here is an example of a translation file that contains descriptions for entities and fields:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: Acme/Bundle/AppBundle/Resources/translations/messages.en.yml

    oro:
        sales:
            #
            # Opportunity entity
            #
            opportunity:
                entity_label:         Opportunity
                entity_plural_label:  Opportunities
                entity_description:   The Opportunity represent highly probable potential or actual sales to a new or established customer
                id.label:             Id
                name:
                    label:            Opportunity name
                    description:      The name used to refer to the opportunity in the system.
                close_date:
                    label:            Expected close date
                    description:      The expected close date for open opportunity, and actual close date for the closed one
                probability:
                    label:            Probability
                    description:      The perceived probability of opportunity being successfully closed


.. note:: Please note that after changing a documentation you need to run ``oro:api:doc:cache:clear`` CLI command to apply the changes to API sandbox.

Documentation File Format
-------------------------

The documentation file is a |Markdown1| document that contains description about one or multiple API resources. Please note that the |Markdown Extra| syntax is supported in the documentation file as well.

The only requirement for such document is it should be written in a particular format.

Each resource documentation should starts from '#' (h1) header that contains Fully-Qualified Class Name (FQCN) of the resource, e.g.:

.. code-block:: none

    # Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity

As already mentioned above, a single documentation file may contain documentation for several resources. In general, such approach is used to document the main resource and related resources. For example, you can document resources for the User and UseStatus entities in the same file.

Start the next level with the ``##`` (h2) header and use it to announce one of the documentation sections, e.g.:

.. code-block:: none

    # Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity

    ## ACTIONS
    ...
    ## FIELDS
    ...
    ## FILTERS
    ...
    ## SUBRESOURCES
    ...

The section name is case insensitive. They are used only by the documentation parser to identify the documentation part.
The following table describes the purposes of each documentation section:

+----------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Section name   | Description                                  |
+================+==============================================+
| ACTIONS        | Contains a documentation of actions.         |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------+
| FIELDS         | Contains a description of fields.            |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------+
| FILTERS        | Contains a description of filters.           |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------+
| SUBRESOURCES   | Contains a documentation of sub-resources.   |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------+

The third level ``###`` (h3) header depends on the section type and can be action name, field name, filter name or sub-resource name.

The fourth level ``####`` (h4) header can be used only for the **FIELDS** and **SUBRESOURCES** sections. For the **FIELDS** section it can be used for the case when it is needed to specify the description for a field in a particular action. For the **SUBRESOURCES** section it is a sub-resource action name.

The action names in the **FIELDS** section can be combined using comma, e.g.: "create, update". It allows to avoid copy-paste when you need the same description for several actions.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

    # Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity

    ## ACTIONS

    ### get

    The documentation for an action, in this example for "get" action.
    May contain any formatting e.g.: ordered or unordered lists,
     request or response examples, links, text in bold or italic, etc.

    ## FIELDS

    ### name

    The description for "name" field.
    May contain any formatting e.g.: ordered or unordered lists,
     request or response examples, links, text in bold or italic, etc.

    #### get

    The description for "name" field for "get" action.
    May contain any formatting e.g.: ordered or unordered lists,
     request or response examples, links, text in bold or italic, etc.

    #### create, update

    The description for "name" field for "create" and "update" actions.
    May contain any formatting e.g.: ordered or unordered lists,
     request or response examples, links, text in bold or italic, etc.

    ## FILTERS

    ### name

    The description for a filter by "name" field.
    The formatting is not allowed here.

    ## SUBRESOURCES

    ### contacts

    #### get_subresource

    The documentation for a sub-resource, in this example for "get_subresource" action for "contacts" sub-resource.
    May contain any formatting e.g.: ordered or unordered lists,
     request or response examples, links, text in bold or italic, etc.

Use the ``{@inheritdoc}`` placeholder to get the common documentation for an action, a field or a filter. This placeholder works only for the **ACTIONS**, **FIELDS** and **FILTERS** sections.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

    # Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity

    ## ACTIONS

    ### create

    Create a new acme entity record.
    The created record is returned in the response.

    {@inheritdoc}

    ## FIELDS

    ### name

    #### create

    {@inheritdoc}

    **The required field.**

Use the ``{@inheritdoc:description}`` placeholder to get the system-wide description of a configurable entity or field. This placeholder works only for the **ACTIONS** and **FIELDS** sections. Usually, this placeholder is used when you need to replace the existing documentation completely and add the system-wide description to new documentation.

Use the ``{@request}`` tag to add documentation depends on the request type. The full signature of this tag is ``{@request:expression}some text{@/request}``. The expression can contain the following operators:

-  ``&`` - logical AND
-  ``|`` - logical OR
-  ``!`` - logical NOT

For example, to add a text for the |JSON:API| request type for all requests excluding REST API, use the following expression: ``json_api&!rest``.

Example:

.. code-block:: none

    # Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity

    ## ACTIONS

    ### create

    Create a new acme entity record.
    The created record is returned in the response.

    {@inheritdoc}

    {@request:json_api}
    Example:

    ` ` `JSON
    {
        "data": {
           "type": "entities",
           "attributes": {
              "name": "Test Entity"
           }
        }
    }
    ` ` `
    {@/request}

    ## FIELDS

    ### name

    #### create

    {@inheritdoc}

    **The required field.**

Use the ``{@feature}`` tag to add documentation depends on a feature (see :ref:`FeatureToggleBundle <bundle-docs-platform-feature-toggle-bundle>`). The full signature of this tag is ``{@feature:expression}some text{@/feature}``. The expression can contain the following operators:

-  ``&`` - logical AND
-  ``|`` - logical OR
-  ``!`` - logical NOT

For example, to add a text when ``feature1`` is enabled and ``feature2`` is disabled, use the following expression: ``feature1&!feature2``.
