   - **Label** -- Enter the label that would be assigned to the product family.
   - **Enabled** -- Select this check box to be able to bind a product to the product family.
   - **Image** -- Add an image to the product family, if necessary.
   
4. In the **Attributes** section, link the attributes to the product family and organize them into groups as described in the sections below.

   .. important:: Ensure that every system attribute is linked to the proper attribute group in the product family. By default, they are linked to the default_group, but you may modify the link as necessary.

6. Once you are happy with the product attribute organization, click **Save**.
