Schedule Price Adjustments
==========================

For season sales or any other temporary price amendments, you can create a dedicated price list, configure it to be the highest priority, then enable and disable it on schedule to cover the planned sales time frames.

Scheduled price activation helps eliminate the unwanted pressure of the price management during the hot hours and helps you and your salespeople focus on your customers.

To schedule price activation and deactivation:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Price Lists** in the main menu.

3. In the **General** section, next to the **Schedule**, add a timetable for price list activation and deactivation:

   a) Click *Choose a date* to open the calendar and pick the date.
