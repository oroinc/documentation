An account can aggregate details of all the :term:`customer identities <Customer Identity>` assigned to it, providing

Manage Account Records
----------------------

Accounts View Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following sections are available for the account :ref:`page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>`:

1. The **Page Header** has the date of account creation and its latest update, as well as its :term:`lifetime sales value <Lifetime Sales Value>`.

2. The **General** section is for general details of the account, such as its name, tags, description and all the contacts assigned to the account.

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/account_view_general_new.png
      :alt: General information about account

3. The **Activity** section includes any :ref:`activities <user-guide-activities>` related to the account, such as attachments, calls, calendar events, notes, emails or tasks (if available).

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/accounts_view_activities.png
      :alt: The activity section on the account page, displaying assigned tasks, added notes and calendar events, and logged calls

   .. note:: If an activity-related action was performed for a customer or a contact assigned to the account, they will not be displayed. Only the activities performed directly for the account are available in the section.

4.  The **Additional Information** section provides details of any :term:`custom fields <Custom Field>` defined for the account.
5.  The **Website Activity** section lists customer activities displayed in the *Summary* and *Events* subsections.

    .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/accounts_view_website_activity_1.png
       :alt: Summary activity

    .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/accounts_view_website_activity_2.png
       :alt: Event activity

5.  The **Sections with channel names**. Each section contains details of all the customers that are assigned to this account and belong to the specified channel (e.g. Sales, Magento, OroCommerce).

    .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/accounts_view_channels_new.png
       :alt: The sections with channel names
    .. note:: The number and names of such sections depend on the number and names of OroCRM channels and customer records assigned to the account. The type of channels can vary depending on your configurations and integrations (e.g. Sales, Magento, Commerce).

    Records of other entities assigned to this channel with regard to a specific customer are represented as subsections.

    For instance:

    * If an account relates to a Magento customer, its view page will have the **Magento** section displayed. Its subsections will be the following:

      1. The *General Info* subsection has the general information on the Magento customer related to the account (e.g. name, email, customer group, website, etc.)
      2. The *Magento Orders* subsection lists all the :ref:`orders <user-guide-magento-orders-create>` related to the account.
      3. The *Magento Purchases* subsection gives a quick overview of the products that the customer recently purchased. Products disappear from the list if an order is cancelled or deleted on the Magento side.
      4. The *Magento Shopping Carts* subsection shows the details of the :ref:`shopping carts <user-guide-magento-carts-create>` related to the account.
      5. The *Magento Credit Memos* subsection is for :ref:`credit memo <user-guide--sales--magento-credit-memos>` and order details, such as the store from which the order has been placed, order number, the amount refunded, etc.
      6. The *Magento Order Notes* subsection show the comments added to an order on the Magento side as notes in Oro.

     .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/account_subsections_new2.png
        :alt: The magento section

    * Within the **Sales** Channel section you will be able to see:

      1. The Business Customer(s) related to the selected account.
      2. Once one of the customers is selected, you can see their general details and information on related Leads/Opportunities.

      .. note:: In new installations of OroCRM (2.0 and higher) the functions of a Sales channel are reduced to enabling Business Customers and controlling their grouping at the Account view. It is, therefore, no longer essential to create a Sales channel to enable leads and opportunities â€“ these are enabled as features.

      .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/accounts_view_channels_2.png
         :alt: Opportunities for customers displayed in the sales channel on the account page

    * Within a **Commerce** Channel, there are seven tabs with Commerce customer-related information:

      1. General
      2. Customer Users
      3. Shopping Lists
      4. Requests For Quote
      5. Quotes
      6. Orders
      7. Opportunities.

.. _user-guide-accounts-merge:

Merging Accounts
""""""""""""""""

Once the accounts have been added to the system you can :ref:`merge <user-guide-accounts-merge>` them, to get a full
view of customer activities, regardless of the :term:`channels <Channel>`. This can be useful if, for example, it has
appeared that several accounts have been created for the different representatives of the same client, or that your
business-to-business partner is co-operating with you from a new channel (e.g. started buying from your Magento store).

In order to merge accounts:

1. Go to the list of all accounts.

2. Find the accounts that you want to merge.

3. Click the **Merge** icon. (See :ref:`Merge Records <doc-grids-actions-records-merge>`).

   As an example, we are merging three accounts: Acuserv, Big Bear Stores and Casa Bonita.

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/accounts_merge_01.png
      :alt: Click the merge icon to see merge records

4. Once you click **Merge Accounts**, a table with the merge-settings will appear.

   .. image:: /user_guide/img/accounts/accounts_merge_02.png
      :alt: Click merge accounts


5. Choose the name of one of the accounts that is being merged to give to your new account (Master Record).

6. Choose if the contacts should replaced with the contacts of one account (and which), or if all the contacts should be appended.

7. Choose the default contact of the accounts being merged, that will be given to the Master Record.

8. Choose the description of the accounts being merged that will be given to the Master Record.

9. Choose the owner of the accounts being merged that will be given to the Master Record.

10. Choose if the tags should be replaced with the contacts of one account (and which), or if all the tags should be appended.

11. Click **Merge**.

    A Master Record with merged data of several accounts will be created. The rest of the account details, including details of the customer identities will be appended.
