:ref:`two-way synchronization has been enabled <user-guide-magento-channel-integration-synchronization>`).

   .. csv-table::
     :header: "Field", "Description"
     :widths: 10, 30

     "**Channel**","Choose the channel for which the customer is being created. All the active channels of the Magento type are available."
     "**Store**","Choose a Magento store for which the customer is being created. All the stores available within the channel specified will be available."

     "**First Name** and **Last Name**","Define the name used to refer to the customer in Magento."
     "**Owner**","Limits the list of users that can manage the customer to users whose :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` allow managing Magento customers assigned to the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.). By default, the user creating the record is chosen."
     "**Password**","Define the password for the Magento Customer. You cannot leave the field empty."

   .. note:: The rest of the fields are optional.
