Overview
--------

In order to save and process the details of commercial activity with people or businesses that have authority, budget and interest to purchase goods and/or services from you, for whom the probability of actual sales is not yet high or is impossible to define, use **Lead** records in OroCRM (“leads”). Essentially, leads are prospects or potential sales in a form of contact data. Initial agreement discussions, preliminary price requests or invitations for a bid may be examples of a lead.

.. note:: See a short demo on `how to create and work with a lead <https://oroinc.com/orocrm/media-library/create-work-lead>`_, or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.

Import Leads
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can import the bulk details of updated or processed leads information in the .csv format following the steps described in the :ref:`Importing Leads <import-leads>` guide.

Export

You can export the customer details in the .csv format following the :ref:`Exporting Bulk Items <export-bulk-items>` guide.

Create Lead

To create a lead manually, click :guilabel:`Create Lead` in the top right corner.

The **Create Lead** :ref:`form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` will appear with the following 3 sections:

The **General** section contains the following mandatory fields to be defined:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Owner**", "Limits the list of users who can manage the opportunity to users, whose :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>` allow managing opportunities assigned to the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.). By default, the user creating the record is chosen."
  "**Lead Name**", "The name used to refer to a lead in the system."
  "**Status**", "Three statuses are available for a lead:
    - **New** (newly created lead).
    - **Qualified** (lead is recognized as valid as a result of initial analysis, e.g. there is an interested person or organization behind the lead).
    - **Disqualified** (lead is recognized as invalid as a result of initial analysis, e.g. no person or organization was found behind the lead)."
  "**Channel**","Choose one of active :term:`channels <Channel>`, from which OroCRM will get information on this lead."



The rest of the fields are optional.

The **Contact Information** section contains contact details to be entered for a lead.

Multiple emails, phones and addresses can be added for a lead.

New custom reports can be added. For more details on the ways to create and customize the reports, see the :ref:`Reports guide <user-guide-reports>`.

Using Leads in Workflows
------------------------

You can use
OroCRM’s :term:`workflows <Workflow>` to define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates of leads in the system. New customer-specific workflows can also be created, as described in the :ref:`Workflows guide <doc--system--workflow-management>`.
