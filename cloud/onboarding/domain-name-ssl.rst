Domain Name and SSL Certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. begin_include

We recommend 3 options for setting up a domain name and SSL certificate for hosted environments.

**1. Domain name in oro-cloud.com domain zone**

This is the simplest option where your site domain name follows the *<customer_site_name>.oro-cloud.com* pattern.

In this case, Oro support is fully responsible for maintaining of the domain name as well as SSL certificate and customers must only provide the *customer_site_name* (e.g., myfirmshop).

**2. Custom domain name with Oro supported SSL certificate.**

You can use your branded URL in the domain zone of your company but delegate support of SSL certificate to Oro support team.

You need to add a new domain record to your DNS. Oro support team provides you with IP pointing to your new site in OroCloud.

For this option, Oro needs the following information to provision SSL certificate for your new domain:

* The full DNS name of your OroCloud site.
* Country Name (2 letter code)
* State or Province Name (full name)
* Locality Name (e.g., city)
* Organization Name (e.g., company)
* Organizational Unit Name (e.g., section)
* Email Address

Once you provide this information and have DNS name added to your DNS record, Oro support team will provision, configure and bear full responsibility for renewing or updating the SSL certificate for your OroCloud site. During provisioning of SSL certificate, we will ask you to add TXT record to your DNS to confirm domain ownership.

You should also reconfigure your application so it is not redirected to oro-cloud.com domain, as described in the :ref:`Global Routing Configuration <sys--config--sysconfig--websites--routing>` topic.

Standard OroCloud contract covers provisioning and support of SSL certificate for one domain. Any additional SSL certificates required for an additional domain name (e.g. in different country domain zones) must be contracted and billed.

**3. Domain name and SSL certificate managed by the customer.**

You can provide own certificate to use in OroCloud environment to keep control over it. In this case, the following data must be provided to OroCloud support:

* Full domain name (e.g., b2bshop.myfirm.com) for the OroCloud site.
* Signed certificate for your domain - a file with the *.crt* extension. Wildcard certificate can be used.
* The secret key for the certificate - a file with the *.key* extension.

You also need to add new domain record to your DNS. Oro support team will provision you with IP pointing to your new site in OroCloud.

To mitigate security risks during the transition of the secret key to Oro support team, please upload it to your home directory at you OroCloud production maintenance host. **Do not send it in an email or any messenger!**

You also should reconfigure your application so it is not redirected to oro-cloud.com domain, as described in the :ref:`Global Routing Configuration <sys--config--sysconfig--websites--routing>` topic.

Please keep in mind that you are fully responsible for provisioning, renewal, and support of the SSL certificate that you have provided to Oro.
