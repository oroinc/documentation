Advanced Configuration
======================

Deployment and Maintenance Configuration
----------------------------------------

To modify configuration options for maintenance agent, you need to have the `orocloud.yaml` file placed in the application root. If the application is not yet deployed, modifications can also be made in `/mnt/(ocom|ocrm)/app/orocloud.yaml`.

The `validation` command checks your configuration for syntax errors or wrong configuration values. Use the `files` argument to check custom files or multiple files merge result:

.. code-block:: bash

    orocloud-cli config:validate

    orocloud-cli config:validate /mnt/ocom/app/orocloud.yaml

    orocloud-cli config:validate /mnt/ocom/app/www/orocloud.yaml

    orocloud-cli config:validate /mnt/ocom/app/orocloud.yaml /mnt/ocom/app/www/orocloud.yaml

    orocloud-cli config:validate /mnt/ocom/app/orocloud.yaml /mnt/ocom/app/www/orocloud.yaml /mnt/ocom/app/www/orocloud_prod.yaml

Valid changes are applied within 30 minutes or automatically during deployments.

Use the `help` command to get configuration details or configuration reference:

.. code-block:: bash

    orocloud-cli config:help
    orocloud-cli config:help webserver.limit_whitelist
    orocloud-cli config:help orocloud_options.webserver.limit_whitelist

.. note:: Please do not use double quotes for any variables. Use single quotes instead.

.. note:: Please do not use tabs in `orocloud.yaml` as indentations as they are treated differently by different editors and tools. Since indentation is crucial for  proper interpretation of YAML, **use spaces only**.

With `orocloud.yaml` it is possible to override the following nodes:

**install_commands**

.. hint:: See the :ref:`oro:install <bundle-docs-platform-installer-bundle-oro-install-command>` command description for more information.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        install_commands: # Application commands which run during the installation process
          - 'oro:install --sample-data=n --user-name=admin --user-email=admin@example.com --user-password=new_password --user-firstname=John --user-lastname=Doe --application-url=https://example.com --organization-name=Oro'

.. note:: As most of time the `deploy` operation runs only once, it is recommended to avoid storing any sensitive data (such as email, username, or password) in any files for security purposes. You can omit options like `user-name`, `user-email` or `user-password`. When omitted, they are asked interactively during the `deploy` operation.

**upgrade_commands**

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        upgrade_commands: # Application commands which run during update process
          - 'oro:platform:update'

**git clone configuration**

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        git_clone_recursive: true

.. note:: Please note that by default, ``git_clone_recursive: true``. Allowed values: ``true``, ``false``.

**composer_command**

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        composer_command: '{{composer_cmd}} install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader'

.. note:: Please note that ``{{composer_cmd}}`` is a reserved variable and in most cases during executions it will be replaced with the ``composer`` value. Please, keep in mind that the command format is IMPORTANT and should take the following form: ``{environment variables} {{composer_cmd}} {command} {option1 option2 ... option n}``.

For example:

* '{{composer_cmd}} install --no-dev -vvv'
* 'COMPOSER=dev.json {{composer_cmd}} install --no-dev -vvv'

Some options may also be omitted as they are added automatically:

* The `--working-dir (-d)` option will be ignored because it is added automatically during the `deploy` | `upgrade` command.
* The `--no-interaction (-n)` option will be ignored because it is added automatically during the `deploy` | `upgrade` command.
* The `-v|vv|vvv, --verbose` option will be used (if specified) with a higher priority than the same option in the `deploy` | `upgrade` command, e.g. ``orocloud-cli deploy -vv``.

**after_composer_install_commands**

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        after_composer_install_commands:
          - 'command1'

**db_extensions**

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        db_extensions:
          - 'uuid-ossp'
          - 'pgcrypto'

**before_backup_create_commands**

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        before_backup_create_commands:
          - 'command1'
          - 'command2'

**after_backup_create_commands**

.. code-block:: none


    ---
    orocloud_options:
      deployment:
        after_backup_create_commands:
          - 'command1'
          - 'command2'


Application Configuration
-------------------------

There are two types of pages in OroCloud, maintenance and error. Maintenance pages allow to determine the page you will see when you move the application into the maintenance mode. Error pages allow to redefine the standard pages that will be displayed in the event of the following errors:

* Error 403 can be returned by the application itself when authorization is blocked, and by the web application firewall. 

  .. note:: This status also can also be returned by nginx when the requested URL is forbidden or by the OroCommerce application itself. These pages are mananged by ngnix and the  application respectively.

* Error 451 appears when requests are blocked by the firewall if they do not fit access policy, for example, when a request is coming from a forbidden IP address (see `OroCloud WAF Configuration`_ section for more information)
* Error 501 is returned when when service is not implemented and/or the application does not support the requested functionality
* Error 502 is returned when the server is unavailable (for example, because of the outage).

``error_pages_path`` is a dynamic error page directory configuration. The default location is the ``error_pages`` directory in a repository. File matching works with response codes and hosts, like 503.$host.html => 503.html => ``error_pages`` option value. Supported response codes are 403, 451, 501, 502, and 503.		

Custom maintenance pages, error pages (403, 451, 501, 502), error pages path, web backend prefix, and consumer debug mode can be configured as described below. Keep in mind that the web_backend_prefix parameter must start with "/" but never end with "/" (for instance, '/admin'):

.. code-block:: none

    ---
    orocloud_options:
      application:
        maintenance_page: 'public/maintenance.html'
        error_pages:
          403: 'public/403.html'
          451: 'public/451.html'
          501: 'public/501.html'
          502: 'public/502.html'
        error_pages_path: 'error_pages'
        web_backend_prefix: '/my_admin_console_prefix'
        consumers_debug_mode: true


The ``maintenance_page``, ``error_pages_path`` and ``error_pages`` are relative paths to files in the application repository. When modified, changes are applied after the `deploy` | `upgrade` operation in approximately 30 minutes.

.. note:: Changing the ``web_backend_prefix`` value without notifying the Cloud team can break the back-office of the application. Make sure you create a request to the Service Desk before making any changes. You can also change the value without creating a request. In this case, you should wait for approximately 30 min and then, run ``upgrade:source`` to apply changes.

Webserver Configuration
-----------------------

Webserver configuration can be modified, as illustrated below:

.. code-block:: none

Redirects Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configuration option enables you to setup redirects to the existing URLs of OroCloud application.

* **redirects_map** — the hash where the key is an old URL, and the value is a new URL.

* **redirects_map_include** — list of YAML files with the hashes where the key is an old URL, and the value is a new URL (similar to ``redirects_map``).

X Frame Header Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **header_x_frame: true** — is the default value of the flag. In this case, OroCloud WAF adds the "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN" header when responding to the initial request. It makes it impossible to embed any OroCommerce site into iFrame at any site except itself to fulfill security requirements.

* **header_x_frame_app_control: true** - Ignore "X-Frame-Options" header and allow application to decide if header is required.

Some business cases require embedding the OroCloud site into the iFrame at other sites. You need to set the value to “false” : ``header_x_frame: false``.
This prevents WAF from sending the “X-Frame-Options” header which allows embedding into any iFrame.

Locations Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configuration option is used to manage locations.

* **locations** — the hash of hashes. The top key is the location name; the lower keys are:

   * `type` — location type. Possible values are ``php``, ``static``, ``rewrite``.
   * `satisfy` — defines how conditions are used. Possible values are ``all`` and ``any``.

      * `all` - all conditions must be met for the specific location (logical ``and``)
      * `any` - any condition can be met for the specific location (logical ``or``)

   * `location` — location URI. The value may have regular expressions and modifiers, as it is used in the Nginx location directive.
   * `fastcgi_param` — the hash for php-specific custom variables.
   * `auth_basic_enable` — a boolean trigger for HTTP basic authentication.

      * `auth_basic_userlist` — the hash of hashes with a user name as a key and mandatory nested keys:

          * `ensure` — ensures if the user is **present** or **absent**.
          * `password` — a plain text user password.

   * `allow` — an array of IP addresses or network masks allowed to access location. Use one record per line or ``any`` to allow access from anywhere.
   * `deny` — an array of IP addresses or network masks denied to access location. Use one record per line or ``any`` to deny access from anywhere.

OroCloud WAF Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Approach
~~~~~~~~

OroCloud provides two ways to protect the application from big amounts of requests which can cause denial of service. There are two layers of protection used by the OroCloud application which are illustrated in the diagram below:

.. image:: /cloud/img/cloud/protection_layers.png
   :alt: Protection layers used by the OroCloud application
   :scale: 60%

Requests Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This layer is responsible for filtering HTTP requests depending on their sources. The requests can come from certain:

* IP addresses or networks
* Countries
* User Agents

The rules used by this firewall are defined in the ``access_policy`` section of the `orocloud.yaml` file and are explained below. The HTTP request dropped at this layer of protection has HTTP status 451 which is “Unavailable For Legal Reasons”.

Robot Detection
"""""""""""""""

The application drops requests from the user agents which do not support JS effectively protecting from the simple robots. Any request from a client (browser, robot, etc.), which do not support cookies and JS, is dropped with HTTP status 451, and this client is redirected to the error page. It is possible to whitelist specific user agents using the rules described below.

Rate Limiting Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On this layer, WAF performs rate limiting to detect crawling robots and excessive HTTP requests using the following mechanisms.

Rate limiting algorithm uses 3 parameters: ``rate limit``, ``delay``, and ``burst``. It groups requests by the source IP and destination URI and throttles them to the ``rate limit`` if there are more than a ``delay`` requests per second for a given group of requests. Nginx drops all consequent requests from a group if their amount is bigger than the ``burst`` value. The exact values of these parameters depend on the grouping factor (IP, URI, etc.).

HTTP request dropped at this layer of protection has HTTP status 451 “Unavailable For Legal Reasons”. It is possible to define exceptions for rate limiting using the ``limit_whitelist`` and ``limit_whitelist_uri`` sections of the `orocloud.yaml` file.

Rules Definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WAF Rules
"""""""""

Rules to manage HTTP requests filtering are defined in the following sections of the `orocloud.yaml` file.

Before implementing changes in this file on production, you should always test it at the environment stage to avoid issues with live application.

Source filtering rules are defined in the ``webserver`` section. This is the child element of the ``orocloud_options`` data structure. Here is an example of rules definitions:

.. code-block:: none


    access_policy:
          'ip':
            'type'  : 'allow'
            'allow' :
              - '127.0.0.1'
              - '192.168.0.1'
              - '172.16.0.0/16'
            'deny'  :
              - '10.0.0.1'
          'country':
            'type'  : 'deny'
            'allow' :
              - 'US'
              - 'CA'
          'ua':
            'allow' :
              - 'GoogleStackdriverMonitoring'
              - 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0); 360Spider',
              - 'Mozilla\/5\.0 \(compatible\;\ MSIE\ 9\.0;\ Windows\ NT 6\.1\;\ Trident\/5\.0\)\;\ 360Spider',
            'deny'  :
              - 'AcoiRobot'
              - 'Wget'
          'uri':
            'allow' :
              - '~(^/api/(.*))'

``access_policy`` --- The hash of hashes provides the ability to manage Oro Web Application Firewall and allow or deny requests depending on the source address, source country, user agent, and URI.

All rejected requests receive status 451.

The following hashes can be used:

* ``ip`` — the hash defines the rules for the source IP filtering.
* ``country`` — the hash defines rules for the originating country filtering. The value of `type` key defines if the hash contains the allowed or prohibited countries. Country must be defined by ISO 3166 Alpha1 code. GeoIP database is used to define a country from the source IP.

An example of the rule to allow only the defined countries:

.. code-block:: none


   'country':
     'type'  : 'deny'
     'allow' :
       - 'US'
       - 'CA'

In this example, only the requests from the USA and Canada are allowed. All other requests are rejected.

An example of the rule to deny requests from the defined countries:

.. code-block:: none


   'country':
     'type'  : 'allow'
     'deny' :
       - 'CN'
       - 'RU'

In this example, all requests from China and Russia are to be rejected.

* ``ua`` --- The hash provides the ability to allow or deny requests from the specific user agents. A user agent is defined by the regexp string. Scalar values are transformed to regexps automatically. There are two possible lists for this hash: ``allow`` and ``deny`` to allow or deny requests from the listed user agents.

An example of the user agent rule:

.. code-block:: none


   'ua':
     'allow' :
        - 'GoogleStackdriverMonitoring'
        - 'AdsBot-Google (+http://www.google.com/adsbot.html)'
     'deny'  :
       - 'AcoiRobot'
       - 'Wget'


This example allows requests from the ``GoogleStackdriverMonitoring`` and ``AdsBot-Google`` user agents and rejects all requests from ``AcoiRobot`` and ``Wget``.


* ``uri`` --- The hash provides the ability to allow requests to the specific URI and override the rules defined by other hashes in ``access_policy``. URI can be defined by standard regexp.

An example of the URI rule:

.. code-block:: none


   'uri':
     'allow' :
       - '~(^/api/(.*))'

This example allows any requests to the URI which fits ``~(^/api/(.*))`` regex overriding any rule defined for IP, country, and/or user agent.

Request Rate Limit Rules
""""""""""""""""""""""""

There are two lists to allow any rate of requests for the specific IPs or to the specific URIs. They are the child elements of the ``webserver`` data structure.

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: none


   limit_whitelist:
     - '8.8.8.8'
     - '10.1.0.0/22'
   limit_whitelist_uri:
     - '~(^/admin/test/(.*))'

``limit_whitelist`` --- The list contains source IPs and subnets which are allowed to send requests to the application with any rate. This can be used to whitelist some service IPs which need to perform many requests, e.g., for load testing.

An example of the whitelist:

.. code-block:: none


   limit_whitelist:
     - '8.8.8.8'
     - '10.1.0.0/22'

This rule allows unlimited rate of requests from IP 127.0.0.1 (local host) and subnet 10.1.0.0/22.

``limit_whitelist_uri`` ---  The list contains regular expressions to define URI of the application which must not be limited by request rate. This can be used to whitelist URIs that need to receive many requests, e.g., integration URI.

An example of the whitelist:

.. code-block:: none

   limit_whitelist_uri:
     - '~(^/admin/test/(.*))'

This rule allows the unlimited rate of requests to URI containing the /admin/test/ string.

.. note:: Allowing access via WAF does not affect simultaneous connections limits. Use **limit_whitelist** or **limit_whitelist_uri** to set unlimited connectios for a client IP or URI on the server.

Domain Configuration
--------------------

``webserver``-like configuration per domain:

.. code-block:: none

    orocloud_options:
      domains:
        oro-cloud.com:
          locations_merge: true
          maintenance_page: 'public/oro-cloud.html'
          header_x_frame_app_control: true
          redirects_map:
            '/about_us_old': '/about'
            '/about_them_old': '/about_them'
          redirects_map_include:
            - 'redirects/website1.yml'
            - 'redirects/website2.yaml'
            - '/mnt/ocom/app/redirects.yml'
          locations:
            'de':
              type: 'php'
              location: '/de'
              fastcgi_param:
                'WEBSITE': '$host/de'
              allow:
                - '127.0.0.1'
                - '127.0.0.2'
              deny:
                - 'all'
            'en':
              type: 'php'
              location: '/en'
              fastcgi_param:
                'WEBSITE': '$host/en'
              allow:
                - '127.0.0.1'
                - '127.0.0.2'

Profiling Application Console Commands via Blackfire
----------------------------------------------------

The configuration option enables you to configure Blackfire.

``blackfire_options`` --- The hash is used to configure the Blackfire agent on environment

   * `agent_enabled` — a boolean trigger for Blackfire installation
   * `apm_enabled` - the option enables (1) or disables (0) the Blackfire APM feature. Please note that you need to have it included into your license.
   * `server_id` — a server ID string. Refer your Blackfire account to this value.
   * `server_token` — a server token string. Refer your Blackfire account to this value.
   * `log_level` — Blackfire agent log verbosity.
   * `log_path` — a path to the log file location.


You can then profile the application console commands via configured Blackfire:

.. code-block:: none


    orocloud-cli app:console [command] --blackfire-enable --blackfire-client-id [client-id] --blackfire-client-token [client-token] [--blackfire-env env] [--blackfire-samples count]

.. note:: Make sure you enable Blackfire via orocloud.yaml before using this functionality.

Profiling Application Using NewRelic
------------------------------------

The ``newrelic_options`` configuration option allows you to configure NewRelic profiler (must be installed and configured per separate support request). Please, pay attention that the value of the license_key is provided as an example, and you need to use your actual license key there.

Mail Settings
-------------

To prevent sending test emails accidentally from the staging environment to any real users or customers, add the domains of email recepients that you will be using for testing to your whitelist:

.. code-block:: none


    ---
    orocloud_options:
      mail:
        whitelist:
          - 'example.com'
          - 'examlpe.org'
          - 'example.net'

Where:

* **mail** is a hash of mail-related settings
* **whitelist** is an array of whitelisted mail domains

.. note:: In production environments all domains are whitelisted. When you create a whitelist, it blocks sending email to any recipients, except for the ones in the whitelisted email domains.

.. _orocloud-maintenance-advanced-use-sanitization-conf:

Sanitizing Configuration
------------------------

Regardless of application type (OroCommerce or OroCRM), each has its own default sanitize rules (`sanitize.method.rawsql` and `sanitize.method.update`). However, you can add your own rules, remove a specific default rule, or completely override them.

The sanitize configuration is grouped under the `sanitize` node and supports the following sanitize methods:

* **sanitize.rawsql_add_rules** — the list of raw SQL queries that helps you to sanitize the existing data, for example, delete data using the TRUNCATE method, UPDATE data to apply any custom modification, etc.

* **sanitize.rawsql_delete_rules** —  the list of raw SQL queries, which should be removed from the list in `sanitize.method.rawsql`. The format is the same as `sanitize.rawsql_add`.

* **sanitize.rawsql_override_rules** —  the list of raw SQL queries, which will be applied to sanitizing data and override default sanitize rule `sanitize.method.rawsql`. Please note, that if this option is specified, all `sanitize.rawsql_add_rules` and `sanitize.rawsql_delete_rules` will be ignored. The format is the same as `sanitize.rawsql_add_rules`.

* **sanitize.update_add_rules** — the mapping between specific table columns and the sanitizing method that should be used for the values.

* **sanitize.update_delete_rules** — the list of rules which will be deleted from the list in `sanitize.method.update`. The format is the same as in `sanitize.update_add_rules`.

* **sanitize.update_override_rules** — the list of rules which will be applied to sanitizing data and overriding the default sanitize rule `sanitize.method.update`. Please note, that if this option is specified, all `sanitize.update_add_rules` and `sanitize.update_delete_rules` will be ignored. The format is the same as `sanitize.update_add_rules`.

.. note:: Please keep in mind that **ALL** values in `rawsql_*_rules` and `update_*_rules` **MUST** be wrapped in **SINGLE** quotes.

            custom_email_domain: 'example.com'

General Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please use the following conventions to design your `sanitize.update_*` strategy:

* Provide sanitizing configuration for every table as a new item:

  .. code-block:: none


      update_add_rules:
            - '{ table: oro_address, columns: [{name: street, method: md5}, {name: city, method: md5}, {name: postal_code, method: md5}, {name: last_name, method: md5}] }'
            - '{ table: oro_business_unit, columns: [{name: email, method: email}, {name: name, method: md5}, {name: phone, method: md5}] }'

* Provide the table name in the table node.
* In the columns section, provide an array of column name and sanitizing method pairs for all the columns that should be sanitized in the mentioned table.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: none


      columns: [{name: street, method: md5}, {name: city, method: md5} ]

* Provide the column name in the name node. Use the following sanitize methods/strategies (ensure they reasonably match the column type):

  * `md5` — Replaces the original string with the string hash.
  * `email` — Replaces the email with the sanitized version of the email. When the `sanitize.custom_email_domain` configuration parameter is provided in the `deployment.yml` or `orocloud.yaml` files, the email strategy replaces the real email domain with the custom one provided as `sanitize.custom_email_domain`. If the custom domain is not provided, the sanitized email will be generated randomly. For example, `example@example.com`.
  * `date` — Replaces the date values with the current date and time.
  * `attachment` — Replaces the attachment file content with a dummy blank image.

Elasticsearch Synonyms Configuration
------------------------------------

.. note:: Please avoid simultaneous use of :ref:`search synonyms <bundle-docs-commerce-website-elasticsearch-bundle-synonyms>` and the method of adding synonyms described in this article, as this will lead to unpredictable behavior.

To configure synonyms in Elasticsearch service, use the following field in orocloud.yaml:

.. code-block:: none

    orocloud_options:
      elasticsearch:
        synonyms:
          'index_name1':
            - 'foo, bar, baz'
            - 'spam, eggs, meal'
            - 'null, void'
          'index_name2':
            - 'Alice, Bob, Dave, John'

You can use separate synonym lists for each index, or use '*' as index name in order to apply the same synonyms list to all indices.

.. code-block:: none

    orocloud_options:
      elasticsearch:
        synonyms:
          '*':
            - 'foo, bar, baz'
            - 'spam, eggs, meal'
            - 'null, void'
            - 'Alice, Bob, Dave, John'

.. note:: Please keep in mind that synonyms configuration will be not applied immediately. All changes made in orocloud.yaml require up to 40 minutes to apply. More details for synonyms usage may be found in |official Elasticsearch documentation|.

Environments Data Synchronization
---------------------------------

Cloud-based environments may be synchronized by a user without filing a request to the support team.

To retrieve a list of the environments to which you can sync the sanitized data from the current environment, run the following command:

.. code-block:: none

    orocloud-cli dump:environments

.. note:: If you have no environments in the output, ask the support team to update your environment settings.

This means that you can push data from the current environment to the linked environment.

.. code-block:: none

    orocloud-cli dump:create --help
