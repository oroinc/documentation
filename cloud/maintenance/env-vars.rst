How to Add/Remove Environment Variables
=======================================

|Environment variable| can be configured for application usage, as illustrated below:

.. code-block:: none


    ---
    orocloud_options:
      application:
        env_vars:
          'var1': 'value1'
          'var1': 'value2'
          'varN': 'valueN'

* **env_vars** â€” the hash where the key is an environment variable name, and the value is the environment variable value.

How to Configure Environment Type Based Application
---------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: none


    ---
    orocloud_options:
      application:
        env_vars:
          'ORO_DEPLOYMENT_TYPE': 'local'

* **local** - deployment_type, which will be set to parameters.yml for your deployed application as

.. code-block:: none


    deployment_type: local

.. note:: For more details on the environment type based application configuration, please see the |related documentation in the backend developer guide|.

.. warning:: Environment variables are always string and are not cast automatically to integer, null, or other types. You should never pass an empty environment variable, like 'ORO_DB_HOST=' or 'ORO_DB_HOST=NULL'. Instead, it should never be available (never be set). More information about environment variables is available in the :ref:`parameters.yml description <installation--parameters-yml-description>` section.
