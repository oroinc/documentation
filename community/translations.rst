Help to Translate The Oro Platform
==================================

The Oro Platform supports many internationalization functions including multiple languages and translations.
All translatable strings are defined in each bundle translation domain files and are available via the translation management
service `CrowdIn`_. This service allows to easily collaborate on the translation process and enable more supported

It is very easy to get with the translation process, just submit a request on the `Oro Community Site`_ 
and start working on translations.
