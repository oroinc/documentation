Help to Translate The Oro Project
==================================

The Oro Platform supports many internationalization functions including multiple languages and translations.
All translatable strings are defined in each bundle translation domain files and are available via the translation
management service `CrowdIn`_. This service allows to easily collaborate on the translation process and to enable
more supported languages.

2. :ref:`Propose <translations-propose-translations>` your translations.

3. Wait and :ref:`see your translations added <translations-added>` to the system and
   :ref:`apply <translations-language-settings>` it or :ref:`contact <translations-contact>` the Oro team.
