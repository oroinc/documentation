We would love you to contribute to our source code and documentation, and help us to translate Oro products into multiple languages. The following guidelines and recommendations enable the community to synchronize actions and provide a blueprint for seamless and non-intrusive collaboration.


* :ref:`Use Version Control <code-version-control>`

  Version control is a way to track all the changes made to the product. This topic tells you about the code version system used and describes the way to communicate enough context for every committed code change to fellow developers.

* :ref:`Follow Code Style <doc--community--code-style>`

  Code style is a set of conventions about how to write the source code. The following code styles are used in all Oro projects.

* :ref:`Set Up a Development Environment <doc--dev-env-best-practices>`

  This article describes best practices in setting up a development environment. It up to you
  whether to follow the listed recommendation, however take a note that they can greatly facilitate the development
  process.

  Oro applications support localization and internationalization for multiple languages and locales. In this topic
  you will find general instructions on how to join the Oro translation team and submit you translations.
