Import and Export Functionality
===============================

OroCRM's import and export functionality is a simple way of working with multiple records in CSV format.

If the functionality is enabled for an entity, :guilabel:`Export` and :guilabel:`Import` buttons are displayed
in the top right corner of the grid.

  - First, the *"Validation started. Please wait."* message will appear.

  - When the import has finished, the *"File is successfully imported."* message will appear.

Once import is over, the new entity records will appear in the :ref:`grid <user-guide-ui-components-grids>`.


.. _user-guide-export:

Export
------

- Go to the grid and

  - Click the :guilabel:`Export` button.

  - The *"Export started. Please wait."* message will appear at the top of the screen.

  - As soon as the export is over, the message will change to: *"Export performed successfully, [number]
    downloads exported. Download result file."*

- Click the *"Download result file*" link at the end of the message, and the download will be performed subject to your
  browser settings.

.. note::

    Please note that scope of record details exported, their names and position in the .csv file depend on the 
    :ref:`Import&Export settings <user-guide-entity-management-export-import-common>` of the entity fields.
