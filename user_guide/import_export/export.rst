Exporting Bulk Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You might need to export the necessary information and download it as a .csv file to reuse it in the third-party systems. You can export customer data (accounts, contacts, customers, customer users, business customers), sales data (leads, opportunities, prices in the price list, products), taxes (rates, rules), warehouse, and inventory information (inventory levels and statuses).

Another scenario for using export is when you plan bulk data update that is easily automated in the spreadsheet software (e.g. raise the price by 20%).
