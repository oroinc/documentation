Other Tools
===========

There is a number of tools that all of the system-users, regardless of their roles, may find useful. 

These are adjustable dashboards of target-oriented widgets to collect all the information that user needs at the same 
time on one page; import and export functionality provides for a fast way to upload data into the system and collect 
it for further usage as a .csv file; comprehensive tailored reports collect and visualize historical data and trends 
related to almost any object in the system (so managers can check, for example, the performance straights, salesmen can 
view the conversion levels, marketologists can compare efficiency of different campaigns, ect.); filters and segments
will enable the users to consider only a specific piece of information or group customers, opportunities, users, etc.), 
tags will improve the filtering capabilities.
