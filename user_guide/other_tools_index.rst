Common Tools
============

There is a number of tools that all of the system-users, regardless of their roles, may find useful. 

These are adjustable dashboards of target-oriented widgets to display all the information that user needs at the same 
time on one page; import and export functionality to upload data into the system and 
collect it for further usage as a .csv file; comprehensive tailored reports to  collect and visualize historical data 
and trends related to almost any object in the system; filters and segments to consider only a specific piece of 
information; tags to improve the filtering capabilities.
