Typical CRM Process Stakeholder and Benefits from OroCRM
========================================================

To use the system efficiently, you first need to understand who will be using it and for what purposes and benefits. 
Some of the basic CRM process stakeholders (with no limitation) and the benefits OroCRM can bring them are as follows:

Sales Managers
--------------

Responsible for direct communication with the customers and conversion of opportunities into 
actual orders.

With OroCRM, Sales Representatives can collect and aggregate customer-related information from different sources, gain 
access to personal customer information, and get a clear understanding of the sales and conversion trends for each 
specific customer or a pre-defined group of customers, as well as for the enterprise overall.

The system functionality for sales-related activities is described in the :ref:`Sales Tools section <sales-index>` 
section of the User Guide.
  
Marketing Associates 
--------------------

Responsible for ongoing growth of the customer-base with marketing campaigns and mass mailings.
  
With OroCRM, marketing associates can process customer-related information in order to create targeted marketing 
campaigns, both manually and automatically deliver mass mailings, and track the campaign results.
  
See the :ref:`Marketing Tools section <user-guide-marketing>` of the User Guide to learn more about how OroCRM can 
help with marketing-related activities.

Company Managers
----------------

Responsible for coordination of employees efforts. 

With OroCRM, Managers can create events, tasks, and other activities, and then assign them to any of the system users, 
and define specific workflows to be followed by the company’s staff.  
  
See the :ref:`Productivity Tools section <productivity-tools>` of the User Guide to learn more about how OroCRM can 
help to improve the productivity.

All the stakeholder can also benefit from adjustable grid views and 
filters in OroCRM's UI (described in more detail in the Understanding the UI part of the Getting Started section) and 
other convenient tool including adjustable dashboards with target-oriented widgets, comprehensive tailored reports that 
can collect and visualize historical data and trends related to almost any object in the system, and segmentation engine 
that can focus on any specific piece of information. These and other tools are described in the :ref:`Other 
Tools section <user-guide-other-tools>` of the User Guide.

Administrator 
"""""""""""""

By default, there is always an “Administrator” role assigned to one user that initially gives you access to all the 
records and functionalities available in the system. This is also known as your system administrator. 

While many settings are defined during the system integration, OroCRM's user-friendly UI lets administrators make basic 
changes to its configuration, such as creating and editing new users and system entities, defining permissions and 
access rights, setting-up and managing integrations and extensions, monitoring the system usage of other users, and 
more.

See the system :ref:`System Management and Administration section <system-management-index>` to learn more about what 
administrators can do.

.. hint::

    It is very important to make sure that the administrator is not only good with computers, but also understands the 
    principles, goals and targets of your business. 
  

Setup and Further Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each group of stakeholders can be represented in OroCRM with a specific Role. The way to create roles is described in 
the :ref:`Roles Management guide <user-guide-user-management-roles>`. 

Roles assigned to each :term:`user <User>` define what system modules and functionalities will be available to them, as 
well as what records this user will be able to view, create and process. For example, this way, you can make sure that 
salesmen can see the information important for communications with customers (such as the history of orders, abandoned 
carts, etc.) but cannot manage user passwords in the system. 

This way, roles make the system both more secure, since users with specific roles will only be able to access certain
information), and easier to use, since your employees will not be overwhelmed with excessive information they don't need 
for their job.

.. hint::

    As the company grows or new needs arise, new roles can be created at any time.

Company Structure



For each entity (group of records of similar nature) and each role. you can define the level at which its records will 
be visible, editable, available for creation, etc. as described in the :ref:`Access and Permissions Management guide
<user-guide-user-management-role-permissions>`. This way, you can define that a a specific type of 
records should be visible only to the user that has created them, to all the users of the same business unit, 
to all the users of the same division, or even to any user within the organization. 

For instance, you can set up the system in such a way that all the managers (users with role "Manager") can see the 
personal data of all the customers within the system, but sales representatives can only see the details of customers 
that have been added to the system by users in their unit (so when salesmen from your office in Ohio access the system, 
they will only see details of the customers added to the system from the Ohio office), and freelance sales representative 
will only see the customers they have registered in the system themselves.

When multiple organizations are used, the situation is similar within each separate organization. However, there is one 
more organization which is referred to as the :ref:`system organization <user-ee-multi-org-system>`, users of which, 
subject to :ref:`their permissions <user-guide-user-management-role-permissions-system>`, can reach records of any other 
organization within the system.
