Leads
=====

The Lead records ("leads") represent commercial activity with  people or businesses that have  authority, budget and 
interest to purchase goods  and/or services from you, for whom the probability of actual sales is not yet high or 
is impossible to define. Initial agreement discussions, preliminary price requests or invitations for a bid may be 
examples of a lead. 

In order to save and process details of different leads in OroCRM, you need to have at least one 
:term:`Channel`, for which the Lead entity is assigned, as described in the 
:ref:`Entities section <user-guide-channel-guide-entities>` of the :ref:`Channel guide <user-guide-channels>`.

From this article you will learn how to create new leads, manage existing leads, analyze details of the lead records 
with OroCRM reports and use leads in workflows.


.. _user-guide-leads-create:

Create Leads
------------

- Go to the *Sales → Leads*

- Click :guilabel:`Create Lead` button

- The *Create Lead* :ref:`form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` will appear:

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_create.png

The following fields are mandatory and **must** be defined:

.. csv-table:: Mandatory Entity Fields
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Owner***","Limits the list of users that can manage the lead to users, whose roles allow managing 
  leads assigned to the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.).
  
  By default, the user creating the lead is chosen."
  "**Lead Name***","The name used to refer to the lead in the system."
  "**Channel***","Choose one of active :term:`channels <Channel>`, from which OroCRM will get information on this lead."
  "**First Name*** and **Last Name***","Personal details of the potential customer or contact person." 

The rest of the fields are optional. They keep additional details about the lead (such as the website, name of 
related :term:`B2B customer <B2B Customer>`, industry, address details, etc.) 
and may be left empty.

.. note::

    Optional fields are implemented based on general B2B practices and may be used as required by your 
    business aims and processes.

.. hint::

    If you need to record and process any other details of your leads, custom :term:`fields <Field>` can be created, as 
    described in the :ref:`Entity Fields guide <user-guide-field-management-create>`. 
    Custom fields are displayed in the *Additional* section.


Once all the necessary fields have been defined, click the button in the right top corner of the page to save the lead
in the system.


.. _user-guide-leads-actions:

Manage Leads 
------------

The following actions can be performed for the leads:

From the :ref:`grid <user-guide-ui-components-grids>`:

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_grid.png

- Delete a lead from the system : |IcDelete|
  
- Get to the :ref:`Edit form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` of the lead : |IcEdit|
  
- Get to the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the lead : |IcView| 

- Export and import lead record details with :guilabel:`Export` and :guilabel:`Import` buttons as described in the 
  :ref:`Export and Import Functionality <user-guide-import>` guide. 

From the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>`:

.. image:: ./img/leads/lead_view.png
  
- Get to the *"Edit"* form of the lead

- Delete the lead from the system 

The rest of the actions available depend on the system settings defined in the Communication &  Collaboration section 
of the "Lead" entity
      

.. _user-guide-leads-reports:

Reports with Leads
------------------

OroCRM currently comes with a ready-to-use *Leads by Date* report.

Leads by Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simple but useful report, where you can see how many leads were created on a specific date for 
all of your channels.

In order to see the report, go to *Reports and Segments → Reports → Leads → Leads By Date*

It shows:

- the date leads were created on 

- the number of the leads created on the date, and 

- total amount of the leads created

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_report_by_date.png

New custom reports can be added. For more details on the ways to create and 
customize the reports,  please see the :ref:`Reports guide <user-guide-reports>`.


.. _user-guide-leads-workflows:

Using Leads in the Workflows
----------------------------

You can use OroCRM's :term:`workflows <Workflow>` to define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates of Leads 
in the system. 

Currently, OroCRM comes with a pre-implemented B2B-oriented workflow described in the 
:ref:`B2B Sales Process Workflow guide <user-guide-sales-processes>`. 

New customer-specific workflows can also be created, as described in the 
:ref:`Workflows guide <user-guide-workflow-management-basics>`.
