Lead is defined as its entity:

- :ref:`Create <user-guide-leads-create>` new leads

- :ref:`Manage <user-guide-leads-actions>` existing leads, particularly, import and export lead records and assign
  them different activities

- Analyse details of the lead records with OroCRM :ref:`reports <user-guide-leads-reports>`

- Use leads in :ref:`workflows <user-guide-leads-workflows>`

.. _user-guide-leads-reports:

Reports with Leads
------------------

OroCRM currently comes with a ready-to-use *Leads by Date* report.

*Leads by Date*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simple but useful report, with which you can see how many leads were created on a specific date for 
all of your channels.

In order to see the report go to *Reports and Segments → Reports → Leads → Leads By Date*

It shows:

- the date leads were created on 

- the number of the leads created on the date, and 

- total amount of the leads created

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_report_by_date.png

New custom reports can be added. For more details on the ways to create and 
customize the reports,  please see the :ref:`Reports guide <user-guide-reports>`.

.. _user-guide-leads-workflows:

Using Leads in the Workflows
----------------------------

Workflows define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates related to the entity records. 

Currently, OroCRM comes with a pre-implemented B2B-oriented workflow described in the 
Sales Processes Workflow guide. 

New customer-specific workflows can also be created, as described in the 
:ref:`Workflows guide <user-guide-workflow-management-basics>`.
