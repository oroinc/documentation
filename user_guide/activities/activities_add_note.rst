Add a Note
----------

To save additional information about the record in OroCRM, use the "*Add Note"* action.

.. important::
    By default, the list of activities available for each entity is determined by what is most commonly used by businesses. However, if your company's work process requires it, you can always turn the desirable activity on for almost any entity (except technical ones). If you need particular activities to be enabled for an entity, contact your administrator, or see steps 4 and 5 of the :ref:`Create an Entity <doc-entity-actions-create>` action description

1. Click :guilabel:`Add Note` in the :ref:`actions <user-guide-ui-components-view-page-actions>` tab of the record.

2. The "Add Note" form will appear.

3. This is a text box that you can fill with any text. Formatting tools are available at the top menu.

For example, we want to add a note to the contact Jeffrey Maynard to say that he has changed the company and is eager 
to keep working with us at his new company.
