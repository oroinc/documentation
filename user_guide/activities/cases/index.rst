Cases
=====

Cases are issues or problems reported by customers or found internally. With Oro, you can record, monitor and solve cases in time to ensure that small and big issues do not harm the business of your company.

OroCRM also provides an out-of-box integration with the :ref:`Zendesk <user-guide-zendesk-integration>` customer support platform. Once Oro and Zendesk are integrated, you can sync Zendesk tickets as cases into OroCRM.

In the sections below, you will learn how to create cases in Oro and manage them through their life cycles.
