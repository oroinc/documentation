OroCRM Activities Overview
==========================

An important part of a successful customer relations process is clear and timely communications between all the 
stakeholders. OroCRM's activities enable creation, tracking and ongoing update of customer-related activities such as 
phone calls, emails, tasks, calendar events, and more. Each activity can be processed in the system, according to the 
predefined logic. 

In the course of customization, new activities can be created and their logic can be defined, subject to your specific 
business needs. Follow the links to learn more about the following activities available in OroCRM out-of-the-box:
