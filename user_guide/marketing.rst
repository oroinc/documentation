=======================

Marketing functionality is sharpened to organize and monitor marketing campaigns and mailings.

The four entities are implemented in the OroCRM for the functionality-purposes:

- :ref:`*Marketing List <user-guide-marketing-lists>*` records define the rules used to select sets of contact 
  details for marketing needs

- :ref:`*Campaign <user-guide-marketing-campaigns>*` records represent marketing campaigns and 
  keep their general information, related events and tracking settings.
    
- :ref:`*Tracking Website*` <user-guide-tracking-websites>` records define the rules used to track activities 
  of campaign participants on the Website. 

  Tracking Website functionality requires a campaign created.
    
- :ref:`*Email Campaign <user-guide-marketing-email-campaigns>*` records define the rules used to generate a
  mailing.

  For every Email Campaign marketing list must be chosen, campaign can be assigned and website tracking can be used.
