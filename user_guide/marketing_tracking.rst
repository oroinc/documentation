As soon as a user gets on any of the Website pages, a "visit" is logged. Value of a visit is always "1".*
*As soon as a user gets to the "Orders" page of the Website, an "Order" is logged. Value of an order is the ordered 
item id.*
*As soon as a user gets to the "Item Details" page of the Website, an "View item" is logged. Value of a "View item" is 
the item id.*
