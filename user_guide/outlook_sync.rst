Synchronization with Outlook
============================

OroCRM Enterprise Edition supports data synchronization in the OroCRM and Outlook.
Now, all the contacts, tasks and calendar events available for the user can be synchronized with the specified
Outlook account and vice versa. 

From this article you will learn how to configure and run synchronization, and see the workflow used for that.

    Please note that the following factors can influence the ORO CRM Outlook add-in performance
        
    - Email archiving
    
    - Antivirus
    
    - Mobile devices connected to the computer
   
    - Voice mail

Add-in Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to enable data synchronization from OroCRM go to *"My User"* and click the link to download the add-in to 
integrate with your Outlook client. 

Wait for download to finish and run the installation process.

.. image:: ./img/outlook/settings_1_8.png

System administrators can modify the add-in look:

- Go to System → SYSTEM CONFIGURATION → Integrations → MS Outlook settings → MS Outlook Add-in
- Modify the code to alter the add-in look.

In the example below, you can see the add-in default look:

.. image:: ./img/outlook/addin_view.png


.. sidebar:: Use Default

    Beside each of the settings there is a *"Use Default"* check-box. If the check-box is active, the default value will 
    be used. Default values for each of the settings are described in corresponding sections below.  


Integration Settings on the OroCRM Side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can configure the set of entities to be synchronized, synchronization direction, synchronization 
intervals and priority of the conflict resolution.

Go to System → SYSTEM CONFIGURATION → Integrations → MS Outlook settings → Integration Settings.

    button on the side panel
  
  "
  "**Show Alerts**","

Synchronization Workflow
------------------------

Synchronization Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Synchronization will start automatically, or as soon as the user has clicked :guilabel:`StartSyncNow` 
button on the side panel, subject to the settings defined.

Identifying a Record
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For every entity synchronized, there is also a key defined. The key is a set of field values used to identify an entity
record. Fields of a key can be chosen subject to the specific company needs and defined at the back-end.
The following keys are used by default: 

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Entity**","**Key Fields**" 
  :widths: 10, 30
  
  "Contact","First Name, Last Name, Gender and Birthday"
  "Calendar Event","Title(Subject), Start Time, End Time and whether it is an All-day event"
  "Task","Subject and Task Priority"
  

Every contact, task and calendar event present in OroCRM has a unique ID. When the record is saved in Outlook, the
ID value is saved from OroCRM in the OroCRM_id field.

 
Synchronization from OroCRM to Outlook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synchronization is run in the same way for records of activities, tasks and calendar events: 

.. image:: ./img/outlook/outlook_from_oro_diag.png

All the records processed in OroCRM since the latest synchronization date and available to the user are 
checked:

- If ID of an OroCRM record matches an OroCRM_id value of an Outlook record, the Outlook record is updated. 
  (Values of all the mapped fields in Outlook are overwritten with corresponding values from OroCRM).
 
- If ID of an OroCRM record does not match OroCRM_id of any Outlook records, their keys are checked against fields of 
  Outlook records with empty the OroCRM_id field.
  
  -  As soon as an Outlook record with empty OroCRM_id and matching key is found, it is updated from OroCRM and 
     the ID value is saved from OroCRM into the OroCRM_id field of the Outlook record. 

  - If no Outlook record with empty OroCRM_id and matching key is found, a new record is created in Outlook.


.. note:: 
    
    During the first synchronization or resynchronization, all the Outlook records with a non-empty the OroCRM_id field are
    deleted first, and then OroCRM record keys are checked for all of them.


.. csv-table::
  :header: "**If**","**Then**" 
  :widths: 20, 30
    
  "Such record already exists in Outlook.","Values of the mapped fields of the OroCRM record replace corresponding values 
  for the Outlook record."
  "A record doesn’t yet exist in Outlook.","OroCRM creates the record in Outlook."
  "Multiple matching records exist in Outlook.","OroCRM updates one of them."
  "You've updated a record in OroCRM.","Values of the mapped fields of the OroCRM record replace corresponding values 
  for the Outlook record."
  "You've updated a record in Outlook.","The updates remain in the Outlook record, but won’t sync to the OroCRM."
  "You've deleted a record in Outlook.","OroCRM creates the record again."
  "You've deleted a record in OroCRM.","The record stays in Outlook with no changes."
  

Synchronization from Outlook to OroCRM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ./img/outlook/oro_from_outlook_diag.png

All the records processed in Outlook since the latest synchronization date and available to the user are 
loaded:

- If the OroCRM_id field of a record is empty, a new record is created in OroCRM

- If the OroCRM_id field is defined and 

  - if this is the first synchronization or resynchronization, the record is deleted
  
  - otherwise, the OroCRM_id is checked against ID values of the records in OroCRM:

    - if a record with the matching ID is found in OroCRM, it is updated with data from Outlook
    
    - if a record with a matching ID is absent in OroCRM, it is deleted from Outlook


.. csv-table::
  :header: "**If**","**Then**" 
  :widths: 20, 30
    
  "Such record (record with such id) already exists in OroCRM.","Values of the mapped fields of the Outlook record 
  replace corresponding values for the OroCRM record."
  "A record doesn’t yet exist in OroCRM.","A new record is created in OroCRM."
  "You've updated a record in OroCRM.","Values of the mapped fields of the Outlook record replace corresponding values 
  of the OroCRM record."
  "You've updated a record in Outlook.","Values of the mapped fields of the Outlook record replace corresponding values 
  of the OroCRM record."
  "You've deleted a record in Outlook.","The record stay in OroCRM."
  "You've deleted a record in OroCRM.","The record  are deleted from Outlook."
  
 
Bidirectional Synchronization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Bidirectional synchronization, synchronization from OroCRM to Outlook is performed first and followed by 
synchronization from Outlook to OroCRM.

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**If**","**Then**" 
  :widths: 20, 30
    
  "A record exists in both OroCRM and Outlook.","Values of the mapped fields of the OroCRM record 
  replace corresponding values for the Outlook record."
  "A record doesn’t yet exist in OroCRM.","A new record is created in OroCRM."
  "A record doesn’t yet exist in Outlook.","A new record is created in Outlook."
  "You've updated a record in OroCRM.","Values of the mapped fields of the OroCRM record replace corresponding values 
  of the Outlook record."
  "You've updated a record in Outlook.","Values of the mapped fields of the Outlook record replace corresponding values 
  of the OroCRM record."
  "You've updated a record in the both OroCRM and Outlook.","Subject to your conflict resolution settings."
  "You've deleted a record in Outlook.","The record stay in OroCRM and are be added to Outlook."
  "You've deleted a record in OroCRM.","The record are be deleted from Outlook as well."
