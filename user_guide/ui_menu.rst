OroCRM Menu Items
=================

Below the organization name of the screen, you can see the first level menu items.

.. note::

    In mobile applications the first level menu items are hidden in a list by the organization name:
    
    |header_mobile|
 
The first level menu items define basic OroCRM sections. Click the icon or name to get to the relevant subsections and access corresponding pages or grids. (For better understanding of the grid structure in OroCRM read the :ref:`Grids guide <user-guide-ui-components-grids>).

From each grid you can get to :ref:`Create/Edit forms <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` and 
:ref:`View pages <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of specific records.

In this document you will find the list of all the menu and sub-menu items in OroCRM, as well as links to the documents related to each item.

First level menu is placed below the organization name in the header of the OroCRM page.
