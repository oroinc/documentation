OroCRM Activities
=================

An important part of a successful customer relations process is clear and timely communication between all the 
stakeholders. OroCRM's activities enable creation, tracking and ongoing update of customer-related activities such as 
phone calls, emails, tasks, calendar events, etc. Each activity can be processed in the system, subject to the 
predefined logics. 

In the course of customization, new activities can be created and their logics can be defined, subject to your specific 
business needs. Follow the links to learn more about the following activities available in OroCRM out-of-the-box:

How to Enable Activities for an Entity
--------------------------------------

Most of the activities can be enabled for the entity records in the *Communication & Collaboration* section of the
:ref:`entity edit/create form <user-guide-entity-management-create>`.

- Check the activities that you want to enable for the entity.
                                   
- Choose *Yes* in the drop-down and it will be possible to add free text *Notes* to the entity records.

- *Add Comment* drop-down is meaningful for activities only. You can change the comment setting for the activities
  available in the system.

Once such an activity has been enabled, it will appear in the 
:ref:`actions <user-guide-ui-components-view-page-actions>` tab of the record View pages.
