Integration with Microsoft Exchange Server
==========================================

OroCRM Enterprise Edition supports integration with Microsoft Exchange server. This means that 
emails from mailboxes on the MS Exchange server can be automatically uploaded of to OroCRM.

This functionality enables using single system-wide setting to collect letters of multiple users within organization.

The following settings have to be defined in order to set up the integration:


On the MS Exchange Side
-----------------------

You need Microsoft Exchange Server version 2007 or newer.

The administrator of the Microsoft Exchange Server account must create at least one user with the permission to 
impersonate necessary accounts on the related Exchange Server - super-user.

The impersonation procedure is different subject to a specific MS Exchange version. It is described in detail in the 
relevant documents from the `Microsoft API and reference catalog <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library>`_
(for example, this is the `document <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn722376(v=exchg.150).aspx>`_ for 
Exchange Server 2013).

On the OroCRM Side
------------------

- Go to *System → Configuration → Integrations →  Email settings*

- Check the *"Enable"* box and define the following details:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Server**","Enter the name of your Microsoft Exchange Server instance"
  "Version","Choose the server version from the drop-down menu"
  "Login and Password","Enter the credentials of the super-user."
  "**Domain List**","Define the domains, to which you will grant access. At least one domain **must** be defined."

- Click the :guilabel:`Save Settings` button.

*Now, if the mailbox is on this server, its domain is permitted by the integration settings, it belongs to OroCRM user 
and can be accessed by the super-user of Exchange Server, OroCRM will collect emails from it and save it for the user 
(in the User's activities/Emails and in "My Email" section of this user).*
