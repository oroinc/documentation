OroCRM provides a broad set of navigation tools that allow you to easily access necessary information and tools. The system helps to ensure that frequent actions can be performed with minimal effort by keeping required information at hand. This means no important updates are missed.

The Menu Bar
------------

The menu bar is the main mode of accessing data in OroCRM, and is always displayed on every page. Subject to your 
organization configuration, it may be displayed horizontally or vertically. In the latter case, the menu items will be 
displayed as icons.

In the mobile version, the menu bar can be accessed via the "hamburger" button next to the organization name:

The list of menu items that are available to you depends on your access and permission settings, as defined in your 
organization.

Hover the cursor over a menu item to expand the drop-down menu to see the second-level items. Click on them to access 
any corresponding pages or table views (grids). (See :ref:`Data management basics <user-guide-data-management-basics>` for further 
details.)
