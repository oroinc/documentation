Business Unit Records Management
================================

Business Units can represent directions, departments, units, work-groups and teams of the same organization. 
Top-level units can be created first and lower-level ones will be their sub-units.

Create a Business Unit Record
-----------------------------

In order to create a :term:`Business Unit` record:

- Go to *System → User Management → Business Units*
- Click the :guilabel:`Create Business Unit` button
- Define the general details of the business unit created:

General

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Name**","The name used to refer to the business unit in the UI. This is the only mandatory field."
  "**Parent Business Unit**","Define the business unit to which this business unit belongs (a level higher in the 
  administrative hierarchy), if applicable. This way you can represent the whole structure, creating sub-units many 
  levels down."
  "**Phone**
  
  **Website**
  
  **Email**
  
  **Fax**","You can define these contact details of the business unit, if applicable."
