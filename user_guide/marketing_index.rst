Marketing Tools
===============

Marketing associates are the ones who work at consistency and development of the client-base and make sure the 
sales-levels 
keep going up. OroCRM provides a number of sharpened tools to make running a marketing campaign and analysing its 
results as convenient as it can possibly be. 

Whether it is a one-time mailing or a concurrent news-letter, whether 
you want to know just how many people have read through the commercial or to track each step they have done on your 
website afterwords - OroCRM provides tools for any of that.

From this section you will learn how to generate of Marketing Lists automatically and use them for 
Email Campaigns in OroCRM, Dotmailer and MailChimp; how Magento Abandoned Cart functionality help create lists 
of contacts of customers, who have added an item to a cart in a Magento store but haven't submitted and order; and how 
you can track the user activity on a website and analyze efficiency of a single mailing and a major marketing campaign.
