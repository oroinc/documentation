Marketing Lists
===============

Marketing lists define the rules for automatic generation of contact lists used for marketing purposes (mass call or 
mailing). 

For example, you can create a list of personal and contact details of leads added to the system after 
October 1 with addresses in California. 

.. _user-guide-marketing-lists-create:

Create Marketing Lists
----------------------

Go to the *Marketing â†’ Marketing Lists* and click :guilabel:`Create Marketing List` button 
in the top right corner of the grid.
   
The Create Marketing List :ref:`form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` will emerge.

Define the list settings, as described in the sections below:

.. _user-guide-marketing-marketing-list-create-general:
  
General Details  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following fields are mandatory and **must** be specified:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Name**","Name used to refer to the marketing list in the system"
  "**Entity**","Choose an entity from the drop-down.
  Only entities that have contact details (E-mail or phone number) are available.
  Records of the chosen entity and entities related to it will be used to create the list of contacts."
  "**Type**","Chose the list type from the drop-down:
 
  - **Dynamic** lists are updated as soon as any changes have taken place in the system 
  
  - **On demand** lists will be updated only following the user request"
  "**Owner**","Limits the list of users that can manage the marketing list to the users, whose roles allow 
  managing marketing lists of the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.)
  ."

Optional field **Description** can be filled with free text to help you and other users to understand the purpose or 
peculiarities of the list in the future.

Custom fields may be added subject to specific business-needs.

.. _user-guide-marketing-marketing-list-create-filters:
  
Filters
^^^^^^^

Filters are necessary to choose only those records of the entity that you need for the marketing purposes.
For example, you have chosen "Web Customer" as the "Entity". This includes all the customers of your Magento stores.
However, you want to run a campaign only for active customers from LA who have an abandoned cart.  

To do so, you simple define the rules for filters, to choose only those Web Customer records, for which:

- the field "Is Active"  equals to "Yes"

- the field "City" of their "Addresses" is any of "LA" or "Los Angeles", and

- the "Status" field of the "Cart" is Open.

More information about the ways to define filters is provided in the 
:ref:`Filters Management <user-guide-filters-management>` guide.

.. _user-guide-marketing-marketing-list-create-columns:

Columns
^^^^^^^

.. image:: ./img/marketing/list_columns.png

In the "*Columns*" section, define the set of fields.
The only goal of this set of fields is to visualise records that meet the filter requirements.
Value of the chosen fields will be displayed at the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the 
Marketing List.
  
.. note::

    Marketing activities require some contact information, so at least one column that contains it must be 
    selected. The list of these fields is provided in the *"Designer"* section. (e.g. for contacts these are Primary 
    Email and Primary Phone fields).


.. image:: ./img/marketing/list_columns_01.png
  
- Choose the fields from the drop-down in the *"Column*" section.

- Label is the way the field will be referred to in the grid. The value defined for the field will be added by default, 
  but can be changed. 
  
- Define the sorting order if you want the grid to be sorted by the field value.

- Click :guilabel:`Add` button

.. image:: ./img/marketing/list_columns_ex.png

Use action icons in the last column to edit the grid:

- Delete a column from the list with |IcDelete|

- Edit the column settings with |IcEdit|

- Change the column position, dragging the column by the |IcMove| icon


.. hint::

    Save the list in the system with the button in the top right corner of the page.

- Grid of the list


Marketing List Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The grid contains:

- Columns defined in the :ref:`Create form <user-guide-marketing-marketing-list-create-columns>`

- "TOTAL CONTACTED" column: contains the number of times a record of this marketing list was contacted within 
  different :ref:`E-mail campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns>` 
   
- "LAST CONTACTED" column: contains the date when a  record of this marketing list was last contacted within 
  different :ref:`Email campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns>`
  
  
.. note::

   Please note that if the same record is a part of different marketing lists, its data from other marketing lists will
   not affect the TOTAL CONTACTED and LAST CONTACTED values.
   
- "SUBSCRIBED" column: Initially all the users in the list are subscribed (the column value is "Yes"). If following one 
  of the :ref:`Email campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns>` using the marketing list, a user has 
  unsubscribed, the value is changed to "No" and the user is excluded from the next mailings.
  
In the example below, the marketing list has been used for three Email campaigns. Leads Leo's Stereo and Magne Gases 
have unsubscribed after the second mailing.
