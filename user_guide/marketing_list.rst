Marketing Lists
===============

Marketing lists define a set of contact details to be used for marketing purposes (mass call or mailing).

addresses in California.

You can define conditions used to select the entity records for the marketing list, using the following tools: 

- **Field Condition**: only records that meet the condition are added to the list

- **Conditions Group**: a set of field conditions

- **Apply Segment**: only records that meet a specific set of predefined conditions (belong to a segment) are added to 
  the list. (Segments are subject to a separate document)

Field conditions, condition groups and segment settings can be combined or ORed to define the final set of conditions.

To define a field condition (for example, that all the Leads in the list have been created within the last month):

.. _user-guide-marketing-marketing-list-create-columns:

Columns
^^^^^^^

.. image:: ./img/marketing/list_columns.png

In the "*Columns*" section, define the set of fields displayed in the grid of the marketing list *"View"* page.
It serves the following purposes:

- Inside the system, it helps to visualise the list and see the instances included
- In case of integration with external mailing services (such as MailChimp), values of these fields
  will be available for the external system.
- Marketing activities require some contact information, so at least one column that contains it must be 
  selected. The list of such fields is provided in the *"Designer"* section. (e.g. for contacts these are Primary Email 
  and Primary Phone fields).

.. image:: ./img/marketing/list_columns_01.png
  
- Choose the fields from the drop-down in the *"Column*" section.

- Label is the way the field will be referred to in the grid. The value defined for the field will be added by default, 
  but can be changed. 
  
- Define the sorting order if you want the grid to be sorted by the field value.

- Click :guilabel:`Add` button

.. image:: ./img/marketing/list_columns_ex.png

Use action icons in the last column to edit the grid:

- Delete a column from the list with |IcDelete|

- Edit the column settings with |IcEdit|

- Change the column position, dragging the column by |IcMove| icon

Grid of the Marketing List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The grid contains:

  different :ref:`Email campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns>` 
   
- "LAST CONTACTED" column: contains the date when a  record of this marketing list was last contacted within 
  different :ref:`Email campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns>`
  
  
.. note::

   Please note that if the same record is a part of different marketing lists, its data from other marketing lists will
   not effect the TOTAL CONTACTED and LAST CONTACTED values.

  of the :ref:`Email campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns>` using the marketing list, a user has 
  unsubscribed, the value is changed to "No" and the user is excluded from the next mailings.
  
In the example below, the marketing list has been used for three Email campaigns. Leads Leo's Stereo and Magne Gases 
have unsubscribed after the second mailing.
