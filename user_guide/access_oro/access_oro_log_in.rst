If you are not currently logged into the Oro application, the **Login** page opens.

1. On the **Login** page, enter your |oro_application| credentials: username and password.

   .. important:: Typically, you receive your credentials directly from an administrator or they are automatically sent to the email address specified in your |oro_application| profile upon the profile creation. |oro_application| can be set up to accept your existing corporate username and password. This is possible if your organization utilizes LDAP to share them across multiple applications. Please check with your system administrator to see if this is the case.

2. If you want to be automatically logged in the next time you open the |oro_application| application from this device, select the **Remember me on this computer** check box.
