=======

In OroCRM, you can create reports based on the details of any entity available in the system. 

Using this functionality, you can get easy-to-understand adjustable reports on the amount and activity of different 
customers, on statuses of carts and the current state of actual and potential sales, on the performance of your
:ref:`marketing effort <user-guide-marketing>`, specifics of recent :ref:`activities <user-guide-activities>`, etc.

There is a number of out-of-the-box reports, such as :ref:`Leads by Date <doc-leads-reports>` and 
:ref:`Opportunities by Status <user-guide-opportunities-reports>`, but you can also create your own custom reports.

:ref:`Manage Reports <doc-reports-manage>`

:ref:`Reports Examples <doc-reports-examples>`
