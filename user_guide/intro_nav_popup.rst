Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows
======================================

In the course of the system usage, there sometimes appears the need to inform the user about some events in the system,
for example some operation has been executed or has failed, or you need to be reminded about a task or event.

Success flash messages are displayed against a green background:

|

If something has gone wrong, the flash message will be displayed against a red background in order to attract your 
attention.

|

.. image:: ./img/navigation/popup/flash_error.png

|

Other flash messages have a yellow background.

|

Sometimes, a flash message can contain links to other pages, such as the task reminder above, or this synchronization 
message:

|

.. image:: ./img/navigation/popup/flash_link.png

|

Flash messages appear on the top of the screen for several seconds and then disappear.

If the user must make a decision before the system can go on, a dialog window will appear. The dialog windows have 
buttons and will not disappear until a decision has been made:
