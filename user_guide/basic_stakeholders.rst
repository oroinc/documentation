========================================================

OroCRM is a flexible and extendible open-source customer-relations management system. 

To implement its capabilities in the most efficient way, you need to understand who takes part in your CRM process and 
how they can benefit from OroCRM.

In this article we have collected some of the basic CRM process stakeholders (with no limitation) and the benefits 
OroCRM can bring them.

actual orders.

With OroCRM, Sales Representatives can collect and aggregate customer-related information from different sources, gain 
access to personal customer information, and get a clear understanding of the sales and conversion trends for each 
specific customer or a pre-defined group of customers, as well as for the enterprise overall.
