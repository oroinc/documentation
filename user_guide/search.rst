Search and Shortcuts
====================

Search
------

One of the ways to find a specific record is to use :ref:`grid filters <user-guide-ui-components-grid-filters>`. 
Apply the filter in the corresponding grid. 

However, you can also find a specific record of any entity in the system by its name or by the name of a related entity.

To do so,

- Click the search icon in the top of the screen - |IcSearch|

- Type in the search key the text field, to perform the search.

- Click :guilabel:`Go`

For example, we are searching for "Ann" all over the system:

|

These are our search results:

.. image:: ./img/ui_components/search_ex_2.png

There is total of 28 records, 2 of which are Account names, 6 are names of related entities of Magento Shopping Carts,
there are 9 names of related entities that contain the key in the calendar event records.

You can limit the entities within which the search will be performed. For example, you can look for Ann only in the 
names of Account records.
