Magento Channel Integration
============================

Channels of the *Web* Type in OroCRM are sharpened to support Magento stores. Creation and usage of a Magento Channel is
described in more details in the :ref:`Channel Management <user-guide-channel-guide>` guide. However, no such channel 
can be created nor used, if integration settings have not been defined.

.. hint::
    
    OroCRM can be integrated with different third-party systems and integration can be defined for different Channel 
    Types in the course of customization. Integration capabilities for Magento are pre-implemented.

.. _user-guide-magento-channel-integration-synchronization:

Synchronizing a Magento Channel Data
------------------------------------

Once you have created a Magento type channel and defined its integration details information from the Magento store will 
be uploaded into OroCRM automatically subject to a predefined schedule. 
You can enable two-way synchronization settings and manually start synchronization.


Two Way Synchronization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to enable two-way synchronization:

- Go to *System --> Channels* and click in the row of the grid that contains your Magento Channel

- Click on its Integration link

- Go to *Synchronization Settings* tab of the emerged page

- Check *Enable Two Way Sync* box

- Define the priority in case of conflicts between the data (e.g. the same customer was edited from OroCRM and from 
  Magento:
   
  - Remote wins: Magento settings will be saved in Magento and loaded to OroCRM
  
  - Local wins: OroCRM settings will be saved in OroCRM and loaded to Magento  

  
Start Synchronization Manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to start the synchronization manually:

- Go to *System --> Channels* and click in the row of the grid that contains your Magento Channel

- Click on its Integration link

- Click :guilabel:`Schedule Sync` button. *A sync job has been added to the queue. Check progress.* note will appear. 

- The data is being synchronized. You can click *Check progress* link to see the synchronization status. 

After successful synchronization, you can use OroCRM to manage customer relations at your Magento store, as described 
in the ref: *Magento Entities Management* guide.
