Integration with Magento
========================

OroCRM supports out of the box integration with Magento.
The integration enables loading  data from and to a Magento-based eCommerce store ("Magento store") and processing it in
the OroCRM.
This article describes how to define and edit the integration and synchronization settings.

.. hint::

    While Magento integration capabilities are pre-implemented, OroCRM can be integrated with different third-party
    systems.


On the Magento Side
-------------------

The integration is made possible with the OroCRM Bridge Magento Extenstion. The OroCRM Bridge can be installed through
the MagentoConnect.

|

Once the extension has been successfully installed, you need to login to your Magento account and to set up a SOAP API
user within Magento, as described below:


.. note::

    The integration can also be created without installation of the OroCRM Bridge Magento Extenstion, however the
    synchronization will then take longer, and some options, such as two-way synchronization, and synchronization of
    the custom records data will not be available.

On the Oro Side

Create Magento Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create integration with Magento, create a channel of Magento type as described in the
:ref:`Channels Management <user-guide-channel-guide-create>` guide.

As soon as the channel type is set to *Magento*, a mandatory **Integration*** field  will appear in the "General"
section.

      |
	  
.. image:: ./img/magento_integration/configure_integration.png

|

Click the *Configure integration* link. The form will emerge.

Define the following details in the *"General"* section:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Name***","The configuration name used to refer to the configuration within the system."
  "**SOAP WSDL URL***","A URL of the SOAP v.2 WSDL source (this is the URL of your Magento installation plus
  **api/v2_soap/?wsdl=1**). For example, if your installation were available at

  "**SOAP API Key***","The API Key defined for the Magento user above."
  "**SOAP API User***","The username defined for the Magento user above."

Synchronization Settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Use the *Synchronization Settings* section to enable/disable two way synchronization.

.. image:: ./img/magento_integration/synch_settings.png

Check *Enable Two Way Sync* box, if you want to download data both from Magento to OroCRM and
back. If the box is unchecked, data from Magento will be loaded to OroCRM, but changes performed in OroCRM will not be
loaded to Magento.

If the two-way synchronization is enabled, define the priority used for the conflict resolution (e.g. if the same
customer details were edited from the both OroCRM and Magento):

- *Remote wins*: Magento data will be applied to the both Magento and OroCRM.

- *Local wins*: OroCRM data will be applied to the both Magento and OroCRM.


.. _user-guide-magento-channel-integration-details_edit:

Edit the Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To edit the integration details:

- Go to the :ref:`Edit form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` of the channel and click *"Edit"* link by the
  integration name.

  The integration form will appear. Priory defined settings will be shown in the form. Once synchronization has been
  performed, it is impossible to change the Sync start date.

  .. image:: ./img/magento_integration/edit_form.png

- Click :guilabel:`Done` button to save the changes

  .. hint::

      To remove an integration from the system, go to the :ref:`Edit form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>`
      of the channel and click |IcCross| located next to the integration name


.. _user-guide-magento-channel-start-synchronization:

Start Synchronization Manually
------------------------------

Once integration has been created, the data will be automatically synchronized. However, you can also start the
synchronization manually from OroCRM:

- Go to the System → Integrations → Manage Integrations and click the |BSchedule|
  :ref:`grid action icon <user-guide-ui-components-grid-action-icons>` or

- Go to the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the channel and click the integration name link:

- The *"View"* page of the integration will appear.

  :ref:`job <book-job-execution>`
  *has been added to the queue.   Check progress.* note will appear.

- The data is being synchronized. You can click *Check progress* link to see the synchronization status.

After the successful synchronization, details of the Magento entity records defined for the channel will be loaded to 
OroCRM and can be processed therein, for example cart can be converted, customer details can be edited and new customers
can be added to the system.
