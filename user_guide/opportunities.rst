Opportunities
=============

The Opportunity records ("opportunities") represent highly probable potential or actual sales to a new or 
established customer. For example, request for proposal, invitation for a bidding, agreement of intentions or order for
a delivery are opportunities. 

In order to add and process details of opportunities in OroCRM use Opportunity records you need to have at least one 
:term:`Channel` to which the Opportunity entity is assigned, as described in the 
:ref:`Entities section <user-guide-channel-guide-entities>` of the :ref:`Channel guide <user-guide-channels>`.

From this article you will learn how to create new opportunities, manage existing opportunities, analyze details of the 
opportunity records with OroCRM reports and use opportunities in workflows.

    :guilabel:`Create Field` button.

.. _user-guide-opportunities-reports:

Reports with Opportunities
--------------------------

OroCRM currently comes with two ready-to-use reports on opportunities:

- Opportunities by Status

- Won Opportunities by Period

 
Opportunities by Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simple but useful report, with which you can see how many opportunities with a specific status are available 
in the system, what is their total close revenue and budget amount.

In order to see the report go to *Reports and Segments → Reports → Opportunities → Opportunities By Status*

It shows:

- status of the opportunities

- the number of the opportunities with this status 

- total close revenue of all the opportunities with the status

- total budget amount of all the opportunities with one the status

- total number of opportunities regardless of their status ("Grand Total"), their close revenue and budget amount.

.. image:: ./img/opportunities/opportunities_report_by_status.png


Won Opportunities by Period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This report helps to analyze a process of opportunity closer per period. 

In order to see the report go to *Reports and Segments → Reports → Opportunities → Won Opportunities By Period*

It shows:

- the period, for which data is shown

- the number of the opportunities won within this period 

- total close revenue of all the opportunities won within the period

- total number of opportunities won, regardless of the period when they we won ("Grand Total") and their close revenue.

.. image:: ./img/opportunities/opportunities_report_by_period_month.png 

Use the *period* filter to choose the period length:

.. hint::

    New custom reports can be added. For more details on the ways to create and 
    customize the reports,  please see the :ref:`Reports guide <user-guide-reports>`.


.. _user-guide-opportunities-workflows:

Using Opportunities in the Workflows
------------------------------------

You can use OroCRM's :term:`workflows <Workflow>` to define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates of 
Opportunities in the system. 

Currently, OroCRM comes with a pre-implemented B2B-oriented workflow described in the 
:ref:`B2B Sales Process Workflow guide <user-guide-sales-processes>`. 

New customer-specific workflows can also be created, as described in the 
:ref:`Workflows guide <user-guide-workflow-management-basics>`.
