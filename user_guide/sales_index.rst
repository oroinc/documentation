Tools for Sales
===============

The corner stone of customer-relations management, their essence and target is to sell your goods to the customers and 
have them buy from you again. The tools described in this section will provide your salesmen with clear 360-degrees 
view of all the customer activities, and ability to see the overall picture for any customer or group of customers and 
drill-down to a specific purchase and contact.   

The section mainly describes sharpened out-of-the box tools for sales in business-to-business and Web-based enterprises,
however OroCRM can be tailored and adjusted to meet the needs of any company.
