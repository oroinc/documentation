This page contains a list of tasks assigned to you.


For the description of fields and to learn more about how to manage this list and tasks from it, see the :ref:`Tasks Grid <doc-activities-tasks-grid>` guide. (The page described in the guide contains the list of tasks of all assignees but structurally is the same as the **My Tasks** page, except that you cannot create new tasks from **My Tasks**).

.. tip:: You can also monitor your tasks on the :ref:`My Calendar <doc-my-oro-calendar>` page, in :ref:`Tasks section of your profile <doc-my-user-view-page-activity-tasks>`, and using the :ref:`Today's Calendar <doc-widgets-today-calendar>` and :ref:`Task List <doc-widgets-sidebar-task-list>` widgets.
