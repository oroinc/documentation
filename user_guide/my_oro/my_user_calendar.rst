Calendar
^^^^^^^^

.. add image

At the top you can see the following elements:

* A pager that enables you to navigate through periods.

* The period description.

* The buttons that enable you to set how the calendar displays events. Available options per month, per week, or per day.

Events in the calendar take cells that reflect the time when an event starts and its duration.

An icon in the upper-left corner of the event cell represents the invitation status depending on whether the invitation has been accepted:

-  |IcInvitation| **Not Responded**—This is a basic status of the invitation. It appears in the following cases:

   - You have not given any response to the invitation.
   - You are an event owner and are not required to respond.

-  |IcInviteYes| **Accepted**—You have agreed to attend an event (you have responded **Yes** to an event invitation).
-  |IcInviteMaybe| **Tentatively Accepted**—You are not sure whether you are going to visit an event (you have responded **Maybe** to an event invitation).
-  There will be no icon in the following cases:

   - You are not going to attend an event and have declined the invitation (you have responded **No** to an event invitation).
   - This is the event from the system calendar.
   - The calendar record represents a task.


The |IcReminder| **Reminder** icon in the upper-left corner appears when the event owner configured sending reminders about the event.


From the calendar you can add, view a calendar event, respond to it, edit and delete it, start a hangout meeting, remove a context from a calendar event.

You can also view, edit, and delete tasks.
