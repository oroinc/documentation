Explore Your User Page
----------------------

There are a number of effective tools and actions available on the page of your user profile, from configuring your personal profile to generating an API key for third-party applications. In particular, from the page of your user profile you can:

1. **View your full name, avatar and system information such as status, login count, date and time of the last login.**

   * The first status shows that your are granted rights to use the system. The second status is called an authentication status and shares the state of your password. As you can see your user page only when you are logged into the system, you will always see **Enabled** as the first status and **Active** as the second one. When an administrator views your page, they will able to see the values of your statuses.
