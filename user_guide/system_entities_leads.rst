.. _user-guide-leads-reports:

Reports with Leads
------------------

OroCRM 1.4 comes with two ready-to-use reports related to the leads.

*Leads by Date*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simple but useful report with which you can see how many leads were created at a specific date for 
all of your channels.

To see the report go to *Reports and Segments --> Reports --> Leads --> Leads By Date*

It shows:

- the date leads were created on 

- the number of leads created on the date, and 

- total amount of leads created

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_report_by_date.png

*Lead by Geography*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This report is placed in the *Manage custom reports* section and can be edited. 

Out of the box, the report shows:

- name of the US state (in alphabetic order)

- number of Leads in this State

.. image:: ./img/leads/leads_report_by_state.png

This report may be customized, and other new custom reports can be added. For more details on the ways to create and 
customize the reports,  please see the :ref:`*Reports* <user-guide-reports>` guide.

.. _user-guide-leads-workflows:

Using Leads in the Workflows
----------------------------

Workflows define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates related to the entity records. 

Currently, OroCRM comes with a pre-implemented B2B-oriented workflow described in the 
\:ref:`*Sales Processes Workflow* <user-guide-sales-processes-workflow>`\ guide. 

New customer-specific workflows can also be created, as described in the :ref:`Workflows 
guide <user-guide-workflow-management>`
