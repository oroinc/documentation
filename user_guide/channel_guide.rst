Channels Management
===================

A **Channel** entity represents one source of customers and customer data.

The guide describes how to :ref:`create <user-guide-channel-guide-create>` channels and
:ref:`manage <user-guide-channel-guide-actions>` their records from the UI.

.. _user-guide-channel-guide-create:

Creating a Channel
------------------

1. Go to *System --> Channels* page and click :guilabel:`Create Channel` button in the top right corner to get
   to the *Create Channel* page.

2. Define :ref:`General Details <user-guide-channel-guide-general>` of the Channel

3. Define :ref:`Entities <user-guide-channel-guide-entities>`, details of which will be received from the channel's
   source.

4. Once you have finished adding the entities, use the *Save* function (click :guilabel:`Save and Close`
   or :guilabel:`Save` button in the top right corner). Success message will appear and your Channel
   will be saved in the system.


.. _user-guide-channel-guide-general:

General Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Define basic Channel information in the *General* section.

.. image:: ./img/channel_guide/channels_general.png

The three fields are mandatory and **must** be defined:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Status**","Current status of the channel.

  *Inactive* or *Active*.

  For inactive channels no new data is uploaded to the system (the option is useful
  if a channel is being configured for future use or is out of date.)"
  "**Name**", "Name that will be used to refer to the Channel in the system. It is recommended to keep the name
  meaningful."
  "**Channel Type**", "A drop-down, where you can choose a Channel Type more suitable for the channel  created.

  Channel types define the set of rules and settings applied to the channel.

  There is a proven practice of extending the OroCRM with new channel types to meet specific business needs.

  The following types are available in the current version out of the box:

  - *B2B*: dedicated for managing B2B customer relations

  - *Magento*: sharpened for Magento stores

  - *Custom*: any other channels, subject to specific business needs and goals"

.. caution::

    Once you have selected *Magento* as a Channel Type, new mandatory field **Integration*** will appear.
..    Please, see :ref:`*Magento Channel Integration* <user-guide-magento-channel-integration>` guide  for
..    the details.


.. _user-guide-channel-guide-entities:

Entities
^^^^^^^^

Entities assigned to a channel define what data OroCRM can collect from it.

To add an entity to a channel, use the "Entities" section.

.. image:: ./img/channel_guide/channels_entities.png

One of the entities defined for a channel must represent a customer identity and will be added to the entity list
automatically, subject to the chosen channel type:

- B2B Channel - B2B Customer
- Magento Channel - Web Customer
- Custom Channel - Customer Identity

Some other entities are pre-implemented in the system and sharpened for a specific channel type, e.g. Opportunity
and Lead for a B2B Channel or Cart and Order for a Magento Channel. The entities will be added to the list of
entities by default, once you have selected the channel type, they are optional and may be removed.

**Custom Entities** are created for specific Customer needs and their records can contain any required
details to be filled and processed by the System. For more details on Customer entities please
see the *Entity Management* guide.
Once a Custom entity has been created in the System, it will automatically appear in the drop-down menu in the
Entities section.

To add an entity to the channel list, choose the entity and click :guilabel:`Add` button. The entity will be added
to the list.

.. image:: ./img/channel_guide/channels_entity_select.png

To delete an entity, click |IcDelete| icon. This will remove the entity from this channel's list (not from the System).

.. image:: ./img/channel_guide/channels_entities_delete.png


.. _user-guide-channel-guide-actions:

Channel Actions
----------------

The following actions are available for the channels:

.. From the :ref:`grid <user-guide-ui-components-grids>`

From the grid:

.. image:: ./img/channel_guide/channels_edit.png

- Delete the channel from the system : |IcDelete|

.. caution::

    Once a channel has been deleted all the relevant data will be deleted as well.

- Get to the Edit form of the channel : |IcEdit|

.. caution::

    You cannot change the channel type if data from the channel has been uploaded into the system at least once.

- Get to the View page of the channel :  |IcView|


.. From the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>`

From the View page:

.. image:: ./img/channel_guide/channels_created_b2b_view.png

- Deactivate or activate channels : guilabel:`Deactivate` or :guilabel:`Activate` buttons.

  No new data from the channel will be uploaded to the system from inactive channels.

- Get to the Edit form of the channel : :guilabel:`Edit` button

- Delete the channel from the system : :guilabel:`Delete` button


Editing Entities from a Channel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are sometimes situations when default Entity fields are not enough or excessive. If this is so, Entities may
be edited (list of fields, their type and specific properties may be redefined). This can be done only by duly
authorized Users. Go to the *"Entities"* section of the channel view page.
In the *"Actions"* column, click |IcView| to see the Entity details or |IcEdit| to change the Entity settings.

.. image:: ./img/channel_guide/channels_created_b2b_view_edit_entity.png

.. note::

    If you don't have necessary permissions, you will see a browser-specific message on access denial.

Please refer to the *Entity Management Guide* for more details.
