User Records Management
=======================

Create a User Record
--------------------

In order to create a :term:`User` record:

- Go to *System → User Management → Users*
- Click the :guilabel:`Create User` button
- Define the user settings in the sections described below.


General
^^^^^^^
The "General" section defines the basic settings of the user created. The following fields are mandatory and **must** be 
defined in the section.

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Owner**","Define a :term:`business unit <Business Unit>`, users of which can manage the user, subject to the 
  :ref:`role settings <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`."
  "**Status**","Chose the record status. Possible values are *Inactive* or *Active*."
  "**Username**","The name used to log into the system (login)."
  "**Password**","The password used to log into the system."
  "**First Name** and **Last Name**","Name used to refer to the user in the UI."
  "Primary Email","Email associated with the user in the system."
  
Along with the mandatory fields, there are a number of optional fields provided by default, that can be used to define 
additional details of the customer, such as the name prefix and suffix, the middle name, birthday, additional emails,
and phone number. You can also add the avatar (upload a picture to be used for the user in the UI) and/or 
:term:`tags <Tag>` related to the user.

The "*Send An Email Invitation*" check-box defines whether an invitation email must be sent to the user. The email 
content is defined in the course of the system integration and cannot be edited from the UI.

:ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>` available in the system. Check the boxes to assign the user

.. hint::

    In the community enterprise there can only be one organization, so organizations are not shown in the structure.

.. _user-management-users-email-sync:

Email synchronization settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the "Email synchronization settings" you can enable the uploading of sales-related emails from the defined mailbox 
to your OroCRM account.
Once you've defined the mailbox details, OroCRm will collect any letter on the server such that one of 
its from/to fields is an email address assigned to any contact and the other one is an email address assigned to any 
user in the OroCRM instance.

You can then :ref:`see this emails <user-guide-activities-emails-view>` in the activities of the contact, activities of
the user and in My Emails.
