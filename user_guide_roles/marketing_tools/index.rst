Tools for Marketing
===================

OroCRM's Marketing functionality helps you efficiently organize and monitor marketing campaigns and mailings.

It provides tools for automatic generation of Marketing Lists and their usage for generation of Email 
Campaigns in OroCRM, Dotmailer and MailChimp. Magento Abandoned Cart functionality is a dedicated tool for creating lists 
of contacts of customers who have added an item to a cart in a Magento store but have not submitted the order. 
OroCRM also provides tools for tracking the user activity on a website.
All the Tracking and Email Campaign details can be treated independently or aggregated within a Marketing Campaign.
