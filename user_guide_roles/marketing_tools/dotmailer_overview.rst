dotmailer Integration Overview
==============================

OroCRM supports out of the box integration with dotmailer, allowing you to do the following:

  synchronized.
- Use your address books to create email campaigns in dotmailer and import them to OroCRM.
- Create new contact data fields to capture and/or contain additional information about your contacts.
- Use dotmailer campaign statistics and OroCRM reporting tools to analyze the campaign efficiency.
