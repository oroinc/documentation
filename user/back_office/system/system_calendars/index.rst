System Calendars
================

In your Oro application, you can add calendars with tasks and events related to a specific user, other users in the system
(subject to the :ref:`roles and permissions defined <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`), as well as events 
defined for the whole organization or system.

Events in the system and organization calendars can be viewed by all the users within the system/organization.
The ability to create, edit, and delete events depends on the user's :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` and :ref:`capabilities <admin-capabilities-org-calendar-events>`.

.. note:: See a short demo on |how to create and manage calendars| or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.

Create System and Organization Calendars

You can create as many calendars as you need under the System menu in your Oro application.

To create a system or an organization calendar:

1. Navigate to **System > System Calendars** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create System Calendar**.
3. In the creation page, define the following fields:
   
   * **Calendar Name** --- This is the only mandatory field. Defines the name used to refer to the calendar in the system.
   * **Color** --- Choose the color used to highlight events in the calendar by default.
   * **Scope** --- Define if this is a system or organization calendar (meaningful for enterprise edition only).
