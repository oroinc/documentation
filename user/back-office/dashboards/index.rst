Dashboard Features in the Back-Office
=====================================

:term:`Dashboard` features are all built to give B2B sellers the ability to quickly and easily obtain the relevant data needed to assess business performance.

Dashboards are typically the first thing that sales managers see when they log in. It includes dozens of different data wizards that managers can choose, allowing them to analyze nearly any aspect of their business. When a specific data wizard is not available out-of-the-box, it can easily be created and added to the dashboard. The dashboard is completely customizable and flexible to fit any business need.

Each sales rep, manager, and employee can create and manage their own custom dashboard by adding relevant :ref:`widgets <user-guide--business-intelligence--widgets--explore>`, allowing them to track the data that is most relevant to them (i.e., revenues, lost opportunities, abandoned carts, and more).

By default, each dashboard consists of a set of widgets apart from custom scenarios when you want to use a third-party service to build dashboards. In this case, developers can add custom dashboard types. If the system have more than one dashboard type, new dashboards can be created with the given types. For more information, see :ref:`Add a New Dashboard Type <dev-dashboards-new-type>` in the developer guide.

.. hint:: If you run the Oro Marketplace application, a seller dashboard will be automatically added to each seller organization when a new seller is created through a seller request.
