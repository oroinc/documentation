Create a Record
===============

To create a new record of an entity or update details of an existing record, use the dedicated **Create <Entity name>** and **Edit <Entity name>** pages.

1. On the **All <Entity name>** page (the page with the list of all entity records), click the **Create <Entity name>** button in the top right corner. For example, navigate the main menu to **Marketing > Email Campaigns > Create Email Campaign**.

   Available fields are usually gathered into logical sections. Click the section name to scroll the page to the fields that belong to this section.

3. Save the new record by clicking one of the options in the save menu or discard it by clicking **Cancel** on the top right of the page.
