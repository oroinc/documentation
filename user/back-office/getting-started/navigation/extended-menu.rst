Extended Menu

the list of the most viewed pages in the Oro application.

All the page names available in the lists are clickable links to the relevant pages.

History
-------

This section displays links to the 20 latest pages you have visited in reverse chronological order. This list is particularly useful when you want to open a page that you have recently used without searching for it.

Favorites
---------

The links to all the pages that you have marked as "favorites" are displayed in this section. Most of the pages can be marked as  "favorite". This is handy when you need to return to the same page repeatedly.

To add a page to the favorites list, click the star-shaped *Mark as favorite* icon in the top right corner of the page.

The icon will turn yellow, and a link to the page will appear in the **Favorites** menu.

To remove a page from **Favorites**, open the page and click the yellow star icon.

The icon will turn grey, and the page will be removed from the **Favorites** list.

Most Viewed
-----------

This section displays links to the most frequently used pages. Every time you visit a page, the Oro application recalculates the
statistics and updates the list.
