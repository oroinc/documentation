History

The links to all the pages that you have marked as "favorites" are displayed in the Favorites section to make it easier to return to the same page repeatedly.

To add a page to the favorites list, click the star-shaped *Mark as favorite* icon in the top right corner of the page.

The icon will turn yellow, and a link to the page will appear in the **Favorites** menu.
