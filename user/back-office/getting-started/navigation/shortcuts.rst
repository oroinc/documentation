Shortcuts
=========

Shortcuts are used to perform everyday actions from anywhere quickly. They can also be used to create new records and navigate the system easily. Shortcuts are handy when you are not sure where an entity is in a
menu.

Shortcuts are accessible via the icon in the navigation panel.

From here, you can:

* Launch an action from the "most used" list. This list is updated as you use the system and will initially contain the actions you use most.

* Start typing the name of a related entity or an action to choose from a list of matching items.

* To see all the available shortcut actions, click the *See the full list* link.
