Navigation
==========

The Navigation section guides you on the basics of navigating the default back-office of your Oro application and illustrates how to:

* access a particular section in one click with useful navigation tools
* pin the most important records to monitor the changes and be able to reach them instantly
* pin the page with incomplete configuration to get back to it later and finish the process
* check your session history, favourite pages, and the pages that were open frequently
* add widgets to the sidebar panel, and more
