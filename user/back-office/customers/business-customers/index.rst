Manage Business Customers in the Back-Office
============================================

Business customers represent a point of contact in your sales and business activities. With the help of Business Customers, you can track activities and records associated with them across different channels.

You can create a **Business Customer** record for each customer involved in the business-to-business activity.

.. _user-guide-customers-create:

Enable Business Customers
-------------------------

Enable business customers in your Oro application via a sales channel:

1. Navigate to **System > Channels** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Channel**.
3. Once the form opens:

   * Select a meaningful name for the channel.
   * Set the channel type to **Sales**
   * In the **Entities** section, select **Business Customer** from the list and click **Add**.

4. Click **Save and Close**.

Create a Business Customer
--------------------------

To create a new business customer:

1. Navigate to **Customers > Business Customers** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Business Customer**.
3. Provide the following information:

   * **Owner** --- Limits the list of users that can manage the customer to users whose :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` allow managing business customers assigned to the owner (e.g., the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.). By default, the user creating the record is chosen.
   * **Name** --- The name used to refer to the business customer in the system.
   * **Channel** --- Choose one of the active sales channels, from which your Oro application will get information on this customer.
   * **Account** --- An :ref:`account <user-guide-accounts-create>` to which the customer will be assigned. Details of this business customer will then be part of this account's details.

   The rest of the fields are **optional**. The fields are added to the system based on general B2B practices, aims, and processes and keep additional details of the customer. The optional fields may be left empty.

   .. If you need to collect and process any other details of business customers, :ref:`custom fields can be created <doc-entity-fields-create>`. Their values will be displayed in the **Additional** section.

4. Click **Save and Close**.
