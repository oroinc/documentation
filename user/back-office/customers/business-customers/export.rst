Export Business Customers
=========================

To export business customer details in a .csv file:

1. Navigate to **Customers > Business Customers** in the main menu.
2. To export information on all business customers, click **Export** on the top right.
3. Once the export is complete, you will receive an email to download the .csv file.

.. note:: Keep in mind that by clicking **Export** you download all business customers records regardless of the filters applied to the grid. To export only the list of filtered records, use the **Export Grid** functionality.
