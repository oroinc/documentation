Configure Product Data Export per Customer Group
================================================

You can control whether to allow registered customer users to export products, their prices, and price tiers into a .csv file from the storefront product collection and search results pages. You can configure these settings :ref:`globally <sys--commerce--product--customer-settings>`, per :ref:`organization <sys--users--organization--commerce--products--customer-settings>`, :ref:`website <sys--websites--commerce--products--customer-settings>`, customer group, and :ref:`customer <user-guide--customers--customer-settings>`.

.. hint::
    In addition to configuring product grid export on the configuration levels mentioned above, you can mark "simple" fields of a product as :ref:`Exportable <admin-guide-create-entity-fields-advanced>`. You can also :ref:`mark a price attribute as Enabled in Product Export <user-guide--products--price-attributes-manage>`. The *exportable* setting is available for all "simple" fields (scalar values and select/multi-select enums) of the product entity. Export is not allowed for relations, other complex fields ("WYSIWYG", attachments, etc.), and entityfallback-type fields. Please note that the product name is always included in the export.
