Manage Contacts in the Back-Office
==================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Customer Management <concept-guide-customers>` topic that provides the general understanding of accounts, contacts, customers and customer hierarchy available in Oro applications.

In your Oro application, you can use :term:`contacts <Contact>` to save details of actual people with whom you are getting in touch during the business activities.

.. note:: For a quick guidance, please see a short demo on |accounts, contacts and customers|.

Create a Contact
----------------

.. note:: Checkout a short video on |how to create and edit contact records|, or keep reading the step-by-step guidance.

In order to create a contact:

1. Navigate to **Customers > Contacts** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Contact**.
3. In the **General** section, define the basic settings of the contact created.

   The following fields are mandatory and **must** be defined in the section.

   .. csv-table::
     :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
     :widths: 10, 30

     "**Owner**","Define users that can manage the contact, subject to the :ref:`role settings <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`."
     "**First Name** and **Last Name**","Name used to refer to the contact in the UI."

   The rest of the fields are optional. They can be used to define additional details of the contact, such as the name prefix and suffix, the middle name, free-text description, emails and phone numbers, birthday, etc.

   - With the optional field **Assigned To** you can specify a :term:`User` record, to which the contact will be assigned.

   - With the optional field **Reports To** you can specify another Contact record, that corresponds to a person in charge
     of the contact added (e.g. manager of the department, CEO of the company etc.).

   - You can also add a picture (upload a picture to be used for the contact in the UI) and/or
     :term:`tags <Tag>` related to the contact.

   - With the **Addresses** form you can define Billing and Shipping addresses of the contact. Any amount of the addresses
     may be added.

4. The **Groups** section contains all the :ref:`contact groups <contact_groups>` available in the system. Check the boxes to assign the contact to a group. One contact may be assigned to several groups.

5. The **Accounts** section contains all the :ref:`accounts <user-guide-accounts>` available in the system. Check the boxes to assign the contact to an account. One contact may be assigned to several accounts.

View and Manage a Contact
-------------------------

All contacts available in the system are displayed on the page of all contacts (**Customers > Contacts**). Here, you can view, edit, delete, and bulk delete contacts.

:ref:`Inline editing <doc-grids-actions-records-edit-inline>` can help you amend details of contacts without opening the edit contact form. For contacts, it is available from records' grids and view pages.

If the |IcPencil| **Edit Inline** icon appears next to a value, inline editing is available for it.

To edit contacts from the grid using inline editing, perform the same actions as for inline editing from the contact page.
