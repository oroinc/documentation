Customer User Login Attempts
============================

.. note::
    The feature available starting from platform version 5.0.3.

To simplify investigation of any security-related incidents, the administrator can check the successful and unsuccessful
login attempts of customer users.

The login info data is stored in the database and in the logs in the **security** log channel. The logs have the ID parameter used in the database to enable you to find a particular log item quickly.

The list of all customer user login attempts is available under **Customers > Customer User Login Attempts** in the main back-office menu.

The administrator can also open this list directly from the customer user view page by clicking on the link with the date of the  last login:

In this case, the data in datagrid will be filtered by this customer user:
