Configure Shipping Rules in the Back-Office
===========================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Shipping Configuration <admin-guide--shipping>` topic that provides a general understanding of the shipping concept in OroCommerce.

You can configure one or more :term:`shipping rules <Shipping Rule>` that enable the shipping methods for the provided destinations and set the customized shipping service price by adding a surcharge per service option or globally for all options of the service provider.

Shipping Rules Overview
-----------------------

.. begin-shipping-rules-overview

On the checkout, when a customer user provides the shipping address, the OroCommerce evaluates shipping rules one by one following the Shipping Rules Sort Order. The matching shipping rule may enable one or more shipping method(s) in the shipping options on the checkout and set the shipping service fee components that are used in shipping cost calculation.

To decide whether the shipping rule fits the order or not, OroCommerce uses the shipping destination and the shipping rule condition defined with the :ref:`expression <payment-shipping-expression-lang>`. The condition may rely on the customer order context. When a shipping rule destination and condition matches the order details (e.g. customer, ordered products and the environment), the shipping rule enables its shipping options and shipping fee components.

.. _doc--shipping-rules--overview--stop-further-processing:

Stop Further Rule Processing Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the OroCommerce gets to the shipping rule with the enabled **Stop Further Rule Processing** flag, the remaining rules are not taken into account and their shipping methods are not shown as the shipping options on the checkout. This is helpful when you would like to enforce the recommended shipping method for any location or other conditions it is technically applicable (e.g. use local shipping vendor for all addresses they handle or use the specific shipping vendor that has a VIP SLA with the particular customer). It is recommended to put this type of rules to the top (e.g. setting their sort order to 1).


.. _doc--shipping-rules--overview--shipping-methods-overlap:

Overlapping Shipping Methods Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the shipping option is enabled by multiple shipping rules, only the first occurrence is shown to the customer user—the one from the shipping rule with the lower sort order value which means closer to the top of the list.

For example:

+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+
| Shipping Rule | Sort Order | Shipping Method          | Surcharge |
+===============+============+==========================+===========+
|  A            | 1          | UPS Worldwide Expedited  | +10$      |
+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+
|  B            | 2          | UPS Worldwide Expedited  | +15$      |
+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+

When both shipping rules apply to the order, the customer user gets UPS Worldwide Expedited with +10$ surcharge.


Non-overlapping Shipping Method Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The shipping methods from the same service provider may be enabled in different shipping rules.

In the enhanced example, shipping rules enable more diverse shipping methods:

+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+
| Shipping Rule | Sort Order | Shipping Method          | Surcharge |
+===============+============+==========================+===========+
|  A            | 1          | UPS Worldwide Expedited  | +10$      |
+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+
|               |            | UPS Worldwide Express    | +5$       |
+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+
|  B            | 2          | UPS Worldwide Expedited  | +15$      |
+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+
|               |            | UPS Next Day Air         | +5$       |
+---------------+------------+--------------------------+-----------+

When both shipping rules apply to an order, the customer user can choose from the following shipping options:

* UPS Worldwide Expedited with +10$ surcharge (enabled by shipping rule A).
* UPS Worldwide Express with +5$ surcharge (enabled by shipping rule A).
* UPS Next Day Air with +5$ surcharge (enabled by shipping rule B).

Configure a Shipping Method in a Shipping Rule
----------------------------------------------

After you have added a shipping method to the shipping rule, you are prompted to provide the information that configures the shipping fee components and the method to calculate it.

Flat Rate
^^^^^^^^^

For the :term:`flat rate <Flat Rate>` shipping method, provide the following information:

 * **Price**—A shipping price based on your agreement with the shipping service provider. The final shipping price depends on the **Type** option (*Pre Item*/*Per Order*).
 * **Handling fee**—An additional cost for order processing charged by your company.
 * **Type**—The way a shipping price is calculated for the order. Supported options:

   - **Per Item**—A shipping price for an order is calculated by multiplying product line item quantities (e.g., 5 cups of coffee, 10 napkins, and 5 cookies give us total of 20 items) and flat rate price (e.g. 1$). Finally, we add a handling fee (e.g. 10$) on top of the resulting amount. The shipping cost for this order is 20*1$+10$=30$
   - **Per Order**—A shipping price for an order is calculated as a sum of the specified price and handling fee. For example, if you have specified *$1* for **Price** and *$10* for **Handling fee**, then the shipping price for each order is $1+$10=$11

For example:

UPS
^^^

For the UPS shipping method, provide the following information:

* In the **Surcharge** field on top, enter a value that you want to be added to the standard UPS rates and the option surcharge (like the handling fee per order).

* In the **Additional Options** section, provide the following information for each option that you want to use:

  - **Surcharge**—To customize the shipping cost, enter a value to charge on top of the UPS standard rates (like the extra cost for this shipping method). It is applied together with the global shipping method surcharge.
  - Select the **Active** check box in the **Status** column to enable the option.

For example:

.. image:: /user/img/system/shipping_rules/shipping_rule_method_ups.png

* In the **Surcharge** field on top, enter a value that you want to be added to the standard FedEx rates and the option surcharge (like the handling fee per order).

* In the **Additional Options** section, provide the following information for each option that you want to use:

  - **Surcharge** — To customize the shipping cost, enter a value to charge on top of the FedEx standard rates (like the extra cost for this shipping method). It is applied together with the global shipping method surcharge.
