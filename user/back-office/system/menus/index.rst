Configure Back-Office Menus
===========================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Storefront and Back-Office Menu Management Concept Guide <menu-management-concept-guide>` topic that provides a general understanding of the available storefront and back-office menu types and their management in Oro applications.

In this section, you will learn how to edit and configure the menu for the OroCommerce and OroCRM back-office.

All the menus for the Oro back-office are located in the main menu under **System > Menus**.

.. image:: /user/img/system/menus/all_menus.png

Each menu type has a different purpose that is described in detail in the :ref:`Storefront and Back-Office Menu Management Concept Guide <menu-management-concept-guide>`.


Permissions Required to Customize Menus
---------------------------------------

The ability to configure menus globally, per organization, and for personal use is controlled by the two capabilities: **Manage Menus** and **Access system configuration**.

By default, only users with Admin role have these capabilities enabled and may customize menus on all configuration levels.

To enable a user to personalise menus for themselves and configure menus for each organization individually, include the **Manage Menus** capability into the user role.

To enable a user to configure menus globally, for all organizations, websites, and users whose configuration fall back to the global settings, both **Manage Menus** and **Access system configuration** capabilities should be enabled for the user role.

Back-Office Menus Management
----------------------------

A back-office menu may be multi-level like, for example, a default OroCRM and OroCommerce back-office main menu. The child menu items are nested under parent menu items (e.g., **Accounts**, **Contacts**, **Customers**, and others are nested under **Customers**).

.. image:: /user/img/system/menus/menus_general.png

Menu items on the same level of hierarchy may be visually separated by a divider that looks like a horizontal line and helps you logically organize menu items.

.. image:: /user/img/system/menus/user_menu_divider.png

.. note:: Some menus do not support displaying dividers (on a particular level in the tree, or in general). For example, if you add a divider to the top level of OroCRM and OroCommerce back-office main menu (**application_menu**), the divider is not displayed.

   .. image:: /user/img/system/menus/ApplicationMenu.png

Edit a Back-Office Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view and edit menu contents, click on the menu name or on the |IcView| **View** icon in the corresponding row of the menu list.

.. image:: /user/img/system/menus/Menus.png

On the page that opens, the menu item tree is shown in the left panel. Center is reserved for the menu item configuration.

.. image:: /user/img/system/menus/menus_general.png

Toggle the Menu Tree View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. To minimize or maximize the left menu panel, click a double arrow on the top right of the panel.

2. To expand / collapse all menu items, click the ellipses drop-down menu on the top right of the left panel and click **Expand All** or **Collapse All**.

3. To expand / collapse a parent menu item, click an arrow in front of it.

   .. image:: /user/img/system/menus/edit_menu.png

.. _doc-config-menus-actions-draganddrop:

4. To change the position of an item / divider in a menu, drag and drop it in the left panel. You can change the order of menu items at the same level as well as move an item / divider to the higher or lower level. When you drag-and-drop items, pay attention to the arrow that shows where the item will be placed:

- If an arrow points to the place between items, that is where the moved item will be placed.

  .. image:: /user/img/system/menus/menus_actions_d&dsame.png
     :width: 40%

- If an arrow appears in front of a menu item, then the moved item will become a child of the item that the arrow points to.

Add a Menu Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In the left panel, click a menu item which will be parent for the menu item that you create.

2. Click **Create Menu Item** on the top right and then **Create Menu Item** from the dropdown list.

   The created menu item will appear as the last one on the list of children of the same parent item. You can move it to the position that you need, as described in the :ref:`Toggle the Menu Tree View <doc-config-menus-actions-draganddrop>` action description.

3. In the right part of the page, specify the following information:

   - **Title**—A name for the menu item. This is how this menu item will be represented in the menu.

     Click the |IcTranslations| **Translations** icon to provide spelling for different languages. Click the |IcTranslationsC| **Default Language** icon to return to the single-language view.

     .. image:: /user/img/system/menus/menus_actions_create_translations.png

   - **URI**—A web address of the page or resource that this menu item opens.

     You can specify an absolute URI or one relative to the application URI (as specified in Application Settings in System Configuration).

     If this menu item serves as a non-clickable parent that does not link itself to any resource (like **Customers** in the default main menu), type *\#*.

   - **Icon**—From the list, select the icon that will denote the menu item.

     Sometimes menus (or menu levels) may not be supposed to display icons. For example, icons added to the first level of the main menu (**application_menu**) are displayed only when this menu is set to appear on the left.

   - **Description**—Type a short but meaningful description of the menu item.

     Click the |IcTranslations| **Translations** icon to provide spelling for different languages. Click the |IcTranslationsC| **Default Language** icon to return to the single-language view.

4. Click **Save** to save your changes. If you wish to start creating another menu item right away, click **Save and New** on the top right.
