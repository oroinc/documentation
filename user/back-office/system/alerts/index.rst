Notification Alerts
===================

If an error occurs during integration, a notification alert can be generated (in the code, in the integration implementation itself), which will be saved in the database and displayed in this notification alerts grid.

Based on the data in this grid, developers can also configure flash messages for the user to be displayed in the UI.
