Configure Google Tag Manager Integration in the Back-Office
===========================================================

.. hint:: Google Universal Analytics is deprecated on July 1, 2023 and is replaced with Google Analytics 4.

Integration between your Oro application and |Google Tag Manager| enables you to add tracking tags to your OroCommerce web store pages and collect information on customer behavior, purchases, product clicks, page views, etc. All this information can subsequently be shared with Google Analytics 4 (GA4), enabling you to monitor various user interactions with products on your website. This can help you get a complete picture of on-page visitor behavior, how well your marketing strategies work, and how to target your audience better.

.. hint:: This feature requires a |Google Tag Manager extension|, which you can download from the Oro Extensions Store. Next, use the composer to :ref:`install it on your application <cookbook-extensions-composer>`.

.. hint::
    Please, be aware that you must have |Google Tag Manager1| and |Google Analytics 4| accounts already created to proceed with the integration between your Oro application and Google Tag Manager and pass data to Google Analytics 4.

On the Google Analytics Side
----------------------------

Create a Google Analytics 4 Property
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a GA4 property, navigate to your Google Analytics account.

1. Click |IcConfig| **Admin** on the bottom left.
2. Click **+ Create Property** under the **Property** column.
3. Provide a name for the property, select the reporting time zone and the currency. Keep in mind that Google Analytics tracks only one currency at a time. This means that if, for example, your default currency is set to **US Dollar**, but you have a multi-currency web store (available for the Enterprise edition only), a purchase of 100EUR will be tracked in the converted dollar amount of 107USD (depending on the currency rate that day).
4. Click **Next**. Select your industry category and business size.
5. Click **Create**.

Set up a Data Stream
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you created a property, the next step is to set up a data stream to start collecting data.

1. In your **Admin** menu, make sure you have selected the required property under the **Property** column.
2. Click **Data Streams** and select the platform (Web, Android app, or IOS app) to add a data stream. You can add as many data streams as required.

.. image:: /user/img/system/integrations/gtm/add-data-stream.png
   :alt: Illustrating the steps to be performed to add a data stream

3. For Web, provide the URL of your website (e.g., "mywebsite.com") and a stream name. Click **Create stream**.
4. For IOS app or Android app, add the Android package name, the app name, or the App Store ID, then click **Register app**. Follow the provided instructions to finish the configuration of data streams.

Once a data stream is set, add tags to your web pages via Google Tag Manager.

On the Google Tag Manager Side
------------------------------

Create Tags via GTM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To collect information (events) from your web store, you need to create tags in your Google Tag Manager account for each event you want to track.

There are two ways to create tags:

* :ref:`By importing our preconfigured container with the tags <import-container-to-gtm>` for all collected events. Importing pre-defined tags requires minimal effort, as each tag has already been pre-configured with triggers and variables to enable you to connect to your OroCommerce website.

Or

* :ref:`By configuring tags for all required events manually <gtm4-create-tags-manually>`. Creating tags from scratch is more time-consuming but allows you to provide custom data during configuration or create tags only for specific events.

.. _import-container-to-gtm:

Option 1: Import a Container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have prepared a .json file with a container that includes pre-configured tags to simplify your tag configuration process. You need to import this file into your Google Tag Manager account and substitute the dummy Measurement ID in the **GA4 var** variable with the data stream's Measurement ID of your Google Analytics 4 account.

For that:

1. |Download the .json file (GA4)| with a pre-configured container.
#. Save and extract the archive on your computer.
#. In your Google Tag Manager account, navigate to **Admin > Import Container**.

.. image:: /user/img/system/integrations/gtm/import-container.png
   :alt: Import container in GTM

#. Click **Choose container file** to import the extracted .json file. The file contains 12 tags, 11 triggers, and 11 variables.
#. Choose the workspace and |importgtm| option.
#. Click **Confirm** to start file import.

.. image:: /user/img/system/integrations/gtm/confirm-container-import.png
   :alt: Confirm container import


The container that you have imported contains a dummy data stream's Measurement ID for the **GA4 var** variable. You need to change the ID to be able to transfer correct data to Google Analytics 4.

To change the measurement ID for the imported variable:

1. In your Google Tag Manager Account, click **Variables** in the menu to the left.
2. In the **User-Defined Variables** section, click **GA4 var** to open its configuration page.
3. Click the **Edit** icon.

.. image:: /user/img/system/integrations/gtm/edit-GA4-var-tag.png
   :alt: Edit imported variable configuration

4. Provide the :ref:`measurement ID <data-stream-measurement-id>` of your Google Analytics data stream that follows the **G-XXXXX** pattern instead of the dummy number.
5. Click **Save** to save variable settings.
6. Click **Submit** and then **Publish** on the top right to apply the changes.

.. _ga4-ga-tag-table:

Except for the GA4 tag, the imported container also includes several pre-configured event tags. To customize the pre-defined parameters, refer to the |Google Analytics 4 Event| developer documentation for the list of the recommended event parameters.

* :ref:`add_to_cart <gtm-ga4-add-to-cart>`
* :ref:`remove_from_cart <gtm-ga4-remove-from-cart>`
* :ref:`begin_checkout <gtm-ga4-begin-checkout>`
* :ref:`add_shipping_info <gtm-ga4-add-shipping-info>`
* :ref:`add_payment_info <gtm-ga4-add-payment-info>`
* :ref:`select_item <gtm-ga4-select-item>`
* :ref:`view_item <gtm-ga4-view-item>`
* :ref:`view_item_list <gtm-ga4-view-item-list>`
* :ref:`select_promotion <gtm-ga4-select-promotion>`
* :ref:`view_promotion <gtm-ga4-view-promotion>`
* :ref:`purchase <gtm-ga4-purchase>`
* pageView


.. _gtm4-create-tags-manually:

Option 2: Create Tags Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Google Tag Manager enables you to create one of the two tags that are passed to Google Analytics 4. Those are **Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration** as the principal configuration tag and **Google Analytics: GA4 Event**, which enables you to track custom events.

To create a **Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration** tag:

1. Navigate to the left menu of the Workspace page and click **Tags > New**.
2. Click **Tag Configuration**.
3. Select **Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration** from the tag list.
4. Enter the :ref:`measurement ID <data-stream-measurement-id>` of your Google Analytics data stream.
5. Optionally, add the parameters to configure the **Fields to Set**, **User Properties**, and **Advanced Settings** fields.
6. Click **Triggering** and select the necessary events that would fire the tag when they occur.
7. Save the tag configuration and publish it.

.. image:: /user/img/system/integrations/gtm/configure-GA4-tag.png
   :alt: The steps to be performed to configure a GA4 tag


To create a **Google Analytics: GA4 Event** tag for custom events:

1. Navigate to the left menu of the Workspace page and click **Tags > New**.
2. Click **Tag Configuration**.
3. Select **Google Analytics: GA4 Event** from the tag list.
4. For **Configuration Tag**, select the *GA4 tag* configuration tag you have just created.
5. For **Event Name**, provide the name for the event (e.g., add_to_cart). See the |Google Analytics 4 Event| developer documentation for the list of recommended event parameters.
6. Under **Event Parameters**, click **Add Row**, and provide a name and a value for the parameter. Add as many parameters as required for a particular event. See the |Google Analytics 4 Event| developer documentation for the list of recommended event parameters.
7. Optionally, add the parameters to configure the **User Properties** and **Advanced Settings** fields.
8. Click **Triggering** and select the necessary events that would fire the tag when they occur.
9. Save the tag configuration and publish it.

   :alt: The steps to be performed to create an add_to_cart GA4 event tag manually
