Configure Microsoft 365 Integration in the Back-Office
======================================================

The integrations with Microsoft calendar events and tasks are supported by all applications that include
the Enterprise edition of OroCRM. This documentation describes how to configure these integrations.

.. _user-guide-integrations-microsoft-oauth:

Configure Microsoft 365 OAuth Settings Application
--------------------------------------------------

The integrations with Microsoft calendar events and tasks use the same
:ref:`Microsoft 365 OAuth Integration <user-guide-integrations-azure-oauth>` application as for email synchronization.

To use calendar events and tasks synchronization, add the **Calendars.ReadWrite** and **Tasks.ReadWrite**
API permissions to the list of permissions of the application as well as the default list.

* **Connect** - Allows to connect the Microsoft 365 account for which calendar events and tasks to be synchronized.
* **Sync Interval (In Minutes)** - Determines how often data synchronization will be performed.

By pressing the **Connect** button, a pop-up window with the log-in prompt to the Microsoft 365 is displayed. After a
successful log-in and granting the permissions, the config page will display the Microsoft 365 account name
and the **Check connection** button instead of the **Connect** button.

* **Enable Calendar Sync** - Indicates whether the synchronization of calendar events is enabled.
* **Sync Direction** - Data synchronization direction. Can be Oro to Microsoft, Microsoft, and Both.
