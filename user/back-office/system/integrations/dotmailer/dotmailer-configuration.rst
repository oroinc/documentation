     "**Client ID**","The dotmailer uses OAuth 2.0 to provide single |sign-on|. Client ID is the ID of the OAuth 2.0 making the request. Single sign-on provides the means for a dotmailer user to log into their account just once, removing the need to constantly re-enter credentials. To register to use OAuth you will need to be on an dotmailer Enterprise license and to contact your dotmailer account manager. More information on sign-on is available in the :ref:`Configure Single Sign-on <user-guide-dotmailer-single-sign-on>` section of the guide."
     "**Client Secret key**","The pre-shared client secret, used to authenticate your application when making token request."
     "**Custom OAuth Domain**","Enter custom domain if it is used in dotmailer. By default |https://r1-app.dotmailer.com/| is used."
     "**Default Owner**","Select the owner of the integration. The selected user will be defined as the owner for all the records imported within the integration."

4. Once all the details of the integration have been specified, click **Save and Close**.

   As soon as the integration is successfully configured, it will appear in the integration grid.

   In addition, **dotmailer menu group** will become available under **Marketing** in the main menu.

   The dotmailer menu group contains the following sections:

   - **Email Studio** (see :ref:`Configure Single Sign-on guide <user-guide-dotmailer-single-sign-on>`)
   - **Data Fields** (see :ref:`Manage dotmailer Data Fields and Mappings guide <user-guide-dotmailer-data-fields>`)
