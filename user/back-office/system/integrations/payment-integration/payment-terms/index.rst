Configure Payment Terms in the Back-Office
==========================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Payment Configuration <user-guide--payment>` topic that provides a general understanding of the payment concept in OroCommerce.

In OroCommerce, you can use :term:`payment terms <Payment Term>` configured per customer to help them use the payment conditions guaranteed by their contract with your company.

Payment term is a set of conditions required for the sale to be completed, e.g. the period that is allowed to a buyer to pay off the amount due. Payment terms may also include cash in advance requirement, cash collection on delivery, a deferred payment period of 10/20/30 days, etc.

**To use payment terms in your OroCommerce storefront:**

1. `Enable Payment Terms Integration`_.
2. `Create a Payment Term`_ with the conditions you would like to offer your buyers.
3. `Link a Payment Term to a Customer Based on Their Sales Agreement`_ (optional).
4. :ref:`Create a payment rule <sys--payment-rules>` and add your integration to it to display this method to the customers at checkout.

Enable Payment Terms Integration
--------------------------------

To expose payment terms as a payment method for OroCommerce orders and quotes, enable payment using payment terms:

1. Navigate to **System > Integrations > Manage Integrations** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Integration**.
#. In the **Basic Information** section, provide the following information:

   .. image:: /user/img/system/integrations/payment_terms/payment_terms.png
      :class: with-border

   * **Type** ---  Select *Payment Terms*.
   * **Name** --- The payment method name that is shown as an option for payment configuration in the OroCommerce back-office.
   * **Label** --- The payment method name/label displayed as a payment option for the buyer in the OroCommerce storefront during the checkout. To translate the label into other languages, click on the |IcTranslations| icon next to the field.

     .. note:: It doesn't have to include the payment processor name if you want to hide it from the buyers. For example, you can enter 'Credit Card Payments' if you have a single payment method configured for processing credit cards.

   * **Short label** --- The payment method name/label that is shown in the order details in the OroCommerce back-office and storefront after the order is submitted. To translate the label into other languages, click on the |IcTranslations| icon next to the field.

   * **Status**  --- Set the status to **Active** to enable the integration.
   * **Default Owner** --- A user who is responsible for this integration and manages it.

#. Click **Save and Close**.

Next, set up a :ref:`payment rule <sys--payment-rules>` that enables this payment method for all or some customer orders, create individual payment terms based on the sales agreement with your customers to cover all the agreed payment terms/options, and bind your customers to their respective payment term. You may use only one payment term per customer.
