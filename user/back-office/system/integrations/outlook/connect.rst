Connect MS Outlook Add-in to Oro Instance
-----------------------------------------

.. important:: The Outlook integration is deprecated and therefore no longer maintained. The integration will be removed in version 4.1.

 .. begin_connect_outlook

During add-in installation you are required to provide integration settings to ensure correct work between applications:

1. **OroCRM URL** --- Provide the URL of your instance:

   * If you are running a CRM application, copy the URL from the address bar. Alternatively, copy it from the **Application URL** field by navigating to **System > Configuration > System Configuration > General Setup > Application Settings** (e.g. demo.orocrm.com).
   * If you are running an OroCommerce application, add **/admin** at the end of the URL. Otherwise, connection between the add-in and your Oro instance may fail (e.g. demo.orocommerce.com/admin).

2. **Ignore self-signed certificate** --- Check this box to allow connection to secure servers that use self-signed certificates. We recommend to keep this box checked at all times.

3. **User** --- Provide the username defined on the **My User** page of your Oro instance.

4. **API Key** --- Paste the API key generated in your Oro instance.

   .. note:: You can generate the key by opening **My User** page and clicking **Generate Key** next to the **API Key** option. Copy the key once generated.

5. **Disable Sync** --- this check box defines synchronization conditions.

   * When **Disable Sync** is not selected, synchronization runs automatically within the intervals defined in your Oro instance.
   * When **Disable Sync** is selected, synchronization has to be triggered manually. One way of doing this is by right-clicking on the Outlook add-in icon on the bottom right of your screen and clicking **Sync Now**.

   Alternatively, start sync within your Outlook application by clicking the **ADD-INS** tab, and clicking **Sync Now** in the OroCRM for Outlook settings menu.

6. **Sync Type** --- Select whether you wish to sync all or selected records.
7. **Show Alerts** --- This check box controls whether alerts are displayed in the bottom panel next to the add-in icon:

   * If the **Show Alerts** check box is checked, sync-related alerts pop up in the bottom panel.
   * If the **Show Alerts** check box is not checked, alerts are not displayed.

8. **Sync Birthdays** --- Select the check box if you wish to sync contacts' birthdays.
9. **Check Connection** --- Click **Check Connection** once you filled in all the settings fields. A corresponding message pops up when the connection fails/is successful.
10. **Automatic Updating** --- Define the schedule and conditions for updates.
11. Click **Save** to save these settings.

    When the add-in is installed, you see its icon displayed on the bottom right corner of your computer screen.
