  :widths: 20, 20

  "Subject","Subject"
  "Priority","Priority"

  :header: "**OroCRM Task Status**","**Outlook Task Status**"
  :widths: 20, 20

  "In progress","In progress"
  "Closed","Closed"
  "Open","Open"

The Outlook statuses that are not available in OroCRM are mapped as follows:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Outlook Task Status**","**OroCRM Task Status**"
  :widths: 20, 20

  "Not Started","Open"
  "Completed","Closed"
  "Waiting on someone else","In progress"

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**OroCRM Field**","**Outlook Field**"
  :widths: 20, 20

  "Title","Subject"
  "Start","Start time"
  "End","End time"
  "All-Day Event ","All day event"

.. note::

     Only a calendar assigned to the specified user is mapped, regardless of access settings.

     Invitations, received by the user are sent to Outlook as regular calendar events.


.. .. important:: Be aware that if you add a Google-based account to the existing MS Exchange account, your default calendar may change. This is important to remember when synchronizing events between Oro and Outlook.
