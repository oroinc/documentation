Configure Embedded Forms in the Back-Office
===========================================


In Oro application, embedded forms help create the code that may be added to a third-party website to enable communication between the third-party website users and the Oro application.

Embedded forms may be used to collect requests of marketing, technical, commercial or any other nature.

The fields of an embedded form depend on its type. The two out-of-the-box types of the embedded forms are:

* Contact Request

Additional embedded form types may be created in the course of integration with the Oro application, subject to your specific business needs.
