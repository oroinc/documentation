Next:

1. Log in to the |ups.com|.
2. Navigate to the |UPS Developer Kit| in the **Support > Technology Support** section.

Please, ensure that you have requested separate access keys for your test and production environments.

To enable communication with UPS in order to request the shipping cost estimate and/or request the shipping services, establish a connection with UPS API:

1. Navigate to the **Manage Integrations** page by clicking **System > Integrations > Manage Integrations** in the main menu.

2. Click **Create Integration** and select UPS as integration type:

3. Type in the *Common Integration Details*:

* **Name** – the shipping method name that is shown as an option for shipping configuration in the OroCommerce back-office.
* **Label** – the shipping method name/label that is shown as a shipping option for the buyer in the OroCommerce storefront on the checkout.
* **Short label** – the shipping method name/label that is shown in the order details in the OroCommerce back-office and storefront after the order is submitted.
* **Status** - set the status to **Active** to enable the integration.

4. Set the **Test Mode** into the necessary state. Enable it if you are using the test UPS access key and disable for production access.

   .. note:: For security reasons, it is critically important to use the mode that matches your environment and the UPS access key type.

   .. warning::

      Never use the UPS access key that is dedicated for the production environment in your sandbox/test OroCommerce environment.

      Never enable the Test Mode for the UPS integration on your production instance of OroCommerce.

5. Provide the UPS connection details: API user, password, and API key to connect. Click **Check UPS Connection** to ensure UPS API is accessible.

6. Provide the UPS service account details:

   * Shipping account name
   * Shipping account number

7. Select the pickup type that shall apply to the deliveries for the shipping methods via this integration. Available options are:

   * Regular Daily Pickup
   * Customer Counter
   * One Time Pickup
   * On Call Air
   * Letter Center

8. Select unit of weight to use for the shipping price calculation.

   .. note:: The unit of weight should be in sync with the options that are supported by your UPS account.

9. Select the destination country. To support shipping globally, create a dedicated UPS integration (e.g., UPS USA, UPS UK, UPS Germany, etc) for every country you would like to cover with UPS shipping services.

   Once you select the destination, the list of shipping services appears.

10. Select the UPS shipping services that should be supported in the OroCommerce shipping options. Use *Ctrl*/*Shift* to select multiple options.

11. Set status to **Active** to enable the integration.

12. Click **Save**.

Next, set up a shipping rule via the :ref:`Shipping Rules Configuration <sys--shipping-rules>` page to enable this shipping method for all or some customer orders.

Once the shipping method is added to the shipping rule, provide the information that configures the shipping fee components and the method to calculate it following the :ref:`Configure a Shipping Method in a Shipping Rule <doc--shipping-rules--shipping-methods--detailed>` topic.
