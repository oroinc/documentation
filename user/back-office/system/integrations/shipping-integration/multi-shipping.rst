==========================================================

.. hint:: The Multiple Shipping feature is available starting from OroCommerce v5.0.8. To check which application version you are running, see the :ref:`system information <system-information>`.

4. Provide the shipping method name that is shown as an option for shipping configuration in the OroCommerce back-office.
5. Set the status to **Active**.
6. Select the **Default Owner**. The field is already populated with the name of the user creating the integration. You can change this value to a different user if necessary
7. Click **Save and Close**.

.. important:: Once the integration is created, the next step is to :ref:`set up a shipping rule <sys--shipping-rules>` under **System > Shipping Rules** and add your integration to it to enable customers to select the desired shipping method at checkout.
