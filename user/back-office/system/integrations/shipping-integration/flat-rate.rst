3. Type in the integration name and label (e.g., Flat Rate). Add label translations, if necessary.

#. Set status to **Active** to enable the integration.

Next, set up a shipping rule via the :ref:`Shipping Rules Configuration <sys--shipping-rules>` page to enable this shipping method for all or some customer orders.

Once the shipping method is added to the shipping rule, provide the information that configures the shipping fee components and the method to calculate it following the :ref:`Configure a Shipping Method in a Shipping Rule <doc--shipping-rules--shipping-methods--detailed>` topic.
