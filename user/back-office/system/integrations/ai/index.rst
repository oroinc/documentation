Configure AI Integrations in the Back-Office
============================================

.. note:: This feature is available as of OroCommerce version 5.1.8.

In OroCommerce, you can integrate AI solutions to simplify the generation of content for product descriptions, landing pages, content blocks, master catalog categories, and emails. Integrating AI clients provides several key benefits, including saving time and resources by quickly creating high-quality, engaging content. This allows your team to focus on strategic tasks. It also improves consistency and creativity across all marketing materials, ensuring a unified brand voice.

Supported Clients
-----------------

OroCommerce integrates with two AI clients, OpenAI and Vertex AI.

**OpenAI** is a leading artificial intelligence research lab known for its advanced language models, such as GPT, which can generate human-like text based on given prompts. **Vertex AI**, a product from Google Cloud, provides a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and scaling machine learning models.

The AI Content Generation feature incorporates an AI-powered Content Assistant widget into :ref:`WYSIWYG fields <getting-started-wysiwyg-editor-field-ai>` throughout the OroCommerce back-office. The widget allows users to generate content by providing custom prompts, ensuring grammatical accuracy, expanding or condensing text, and adjusting the tone of the produced content to suit specific needs, whether formal, analytical, educational, casual, or otherwise.

Below is an example of a product description generated using the integration with OpenAI, followed by Vertex AI.

OpenAIâ€™s text generation in your Oro application offers flexibility in length, while Vertex AI provides precise control with options for generating text in specific lengths of 500, 1000, or 2500 words.

Configure AI Content Generation in the System Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------

Once the integration with the chosen AI client is created and established, you can configure AI integration settings in the system configuration :ref:`globally <admin-configuration-ai-integration-settings>` and :ref:`per organization <organization-ai-settings>`. The configured AI client will be used to generate content throughout the application.

When OroCommerce is integrated with AI clients such as OpenAI or Vertex AI, you can use an AI-Powered Content Assistant widget in the WYSIWYG editor to generate content for product descriptions, landing pages, content blocks, master catalog categories, and emails.
