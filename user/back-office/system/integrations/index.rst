* what shipping methods you can offer your OroCommerce customers (UPS, FedEx)
* how to set up integrations with payment and shipping services
* how to use email marketing activities and email marketing automation (Mailchimp, dotmailer)
* how to configure Google single sign-on, Hangouts calls, and Tag Manager
* how to create the code that may be embedded to a third-party website to enable communication between the third-party website users and the Oro application
