Manage Entities
===============

In your Oro application, you can update existing entities, delete custom entities with no records, and manage unique keys to avoid duplication of existing information.

Edit an Entity
--------------

.. important:: The configuration of each specific entity defines which of its properties are available for editing. 

To edit an entity:

1. Navigate to **System > Entities > Entity Management** in the main menu.
2. On the **All Entities** page, choose the entity you want to edit, click the ellipsis menu at the right end of the corresponding row and then click the |IcEdit| **Edit** icon.   
3. Make the required changes following steps 3 to 6 of the :ref:`Create an Entity <doc-entity-actions-create>` section.   

   .. important:: You cannot change the name and the ownership type of the entity.

   There are also several additional fields in the **Other** section that are available only when you edit an entity:

   - **Field Level ACL** --- Select this checkbox to define that permissions can be set on individual fields of this entity. For more information about field level ACLs, see the :ref:`Entity Fields <doc-entity-fields>` topic.

   - **Show Restricted** --- Select this checkbox if you enabled **Field Level ACL** and are going to disable editing of some fields of the entity records but still want users to review the disabled fields on the interface. Fields disabled for modifying will appear dimmed on the interface. For more information about field level ACLs, see the :ref:`Entity Fields <doc-entity-fields>` topic.

   - **Searchable** --- Defines whether record users can search for and find records of this entity via your Oro application's :ref:`search functionality <user-guide-getting-started-search>`.

     - **Yes** --- Select this value from the list if users can search for and find records of this entity.     
     - **No**--- Select this value from the list if records of this entity are invisible for search.

   - **Applicable Organizations** --- Select in which organizations this entity will be available. The default value is **All**. To specify a particular organization, clear the **All** checkbox and click the field that appears to choose the organization from the list.

4. Click **Save And Close**.

Delete an Entity
----------------

You can delete only *custom* entities that have no records. To delete such entities:

1. Navigate to **System > Entities > Entity Management**.
2. In the grid on the **All Entities** page, choose the entity you want to delete, click the ellipsis menu at the right end of the corresponding role and then click the |IcDelete| **Delete** icon.
3. In the **Deletion Confirmation** dialog box, click **Yes**.
4. Reload the page when you see the notification about item deletion. 

  .. note:: If you can still see the entity in the grid on the **All Entities** page, :ref:`update the schema <admin-guide-update-schema>`. 

.. _admin-guide-work-with-entities-unique-keys:

Manage Unique Keys
------------------

Unique keys are a set of fields by which the system matches new information with an existing entity record to determine whether this record is distinct or not. Use unique keys to avoid duplication of existing information. 

For example, by default you can create two contacts with the same information: 

*Jane Roe, born 1985-01-15, \sales@example.com*

The system assigns them different IDs and treats them as different records, but they look the same on the interface and actually represent the same person.

Now imagine that before adding contacts you have defined two sets of unique keys:

* *First Name+Last Name+Birthday*
* *First Name+Last Name+Email*  
   
You create a contact:

*Jane Roe, born 1985-01-15, sales@example.com*

And your colleague Roger tries to add Jane as a contact too: 

*Jane Roe, sales@example.com*

The system checks: 

- The first names and the last names are the same, but the birthday is different (not specified in the second case), maybe these are different contacts.
 
- The first names and the last names are the same, but the email is the same too, so it must be the same contact.

As a result, the system informs Roger that this contact already exists in the system.

To manage unique keys:

1. Navigate to **System > Entities > Entity Management** in the main menu.
2. In the grid on the **All Entities** page, click the required entity.     
3. Click **Manage Unique Keys** in the upper-right corner of the page.    
4. On the **Unique Keys** page, click **+Add**.
5. Specify the required information:
   
   - **Name** --- The set name on the interface. It is used just for reference.    
   - **Key** --- The fields that will be included in this set. Hold the CTRL key to select several fields. 

6. If you need to add another set, repeat steps 4â€“5.
