Examples of Creating Custom Entity Fields
-----------------------------------------

Create an Entity Field With a One to Many Relation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the first example, we are adding a new field called **Referral** to the Customer entity, so we could track the contacts recommended by particular customers. This should be a **one to many** relation because one customer can give details of more than one contact.

To create such field:

1. Navigate to **System > Entities > Entity Management** in the main menu.
2. Using filters, find the **Customer** entity, and click on it once to open its page.

4. For **Storage Type**, select *Table Column*.
5. For **Type**, select the *One to many* relation.

6. For **Target Entity**, select *Contact*.
7. For **Related Entity Data Fields**, select *Description*, *Gender*, and *Job Title*.
8. For **Related Entity Info Title**, select *First name* and *Last name*.
9. For **Related Entity Detailed**, select all the fields available.
10. Click **Save**.
11. On the page that opens, click **Update Schema** on the top right.

To check whether the field has been added to the Customer entity:

1. Navigate to **Customers > Customers** in the main menu. 
2. Click **Create Customer** on the top right.
3. In the **Additional** section, click **+Add** next to *Referral*.

   In the dialog that opens, enable the checkbox next to the required contact, and click **Select**.
   Once selected, the contact is added to the customer record.

Create an Entity Field With a Many to One Relation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the second example, we are creating a **Business Unit** field for the opportunity entity, so that it is possible to relate an opportunity to one of the existing business units. The relation should be **many to one** because one business unit can be related to many opportunities.

To create such field for the opportunity entity:

1. Navigate to **System > Entities > Entity Management** in the main menu.
2. Using filters, find the **Opportunity** entity, and click on it once to open its page.
3. On the page of the Opportunity entity, click **Create Field**.
4. For the **Storage Type**, select *Table Column*.
5. For **Type**, select *Many to One* relation.
6. For **Target Entity**, select *Business Unit*.
7. For **Target Field**, select *Name*.
