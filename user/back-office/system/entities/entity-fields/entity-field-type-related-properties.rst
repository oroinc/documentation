   :header: "Additional Option","Option Description"

   "Stored Externally","Indicates whether the file referenced by this field is stored externally on a third party service. If enabled, the external URL text input is displayed instead of the file upload input. The URLs of the external files should be publicly available.

The system will not process, resize or modify the files that are stored externally."

   "Allowed MIME Types","The list of allowed MIME types. If the field is left empty, it means that all listed extension types are allowed. To define the MIME types allowed for upload, refer to the :ref:`system settings <admin-configuration-upload-settings>`."
   "Use DAM","Setting to **Yes** enables the usage of Digital Asset Manager that changes the usual uploading behavior of the **File** type field for the selected entity. Now, your entity attachments are first uploaded to the DA database that organizes and stores all assets in one place, and then you can select the required asset from the list of available DA records. All attachments that are saved to the :ref:`Digital Assets <digital-assets>` pool can be further re-used by any other entity with the enabled *Use DAM* field for the **File** type. If set to **No**, the usual uploading behavior is applied enabling you to select the asset from your local directory and do not save it to the DA pool. Such attachments cannot be shared and used by other entities.
