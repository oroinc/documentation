Configure Websites in the Back-Office
=====================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Multi-Website Configuration <website-management-concept-guide>` concept guide topic that provides a general understanding of multiple website configuration concept in Oro applications.

You can create multiple B2B and B2C :term:`websites <Website>` that target a particular audience, geography, a specific brand, and a segment of goods or services that your company is providing.

.. important:: Multi-website management is only available in the Enterprise edition.

Every website may have:

* A dedicated web catalog that defines the website content (products, categories, web pages, etc)
* A set of price lists that may be isolated from the other websites
* Unique configuration that may (but not necessarily should) override the organization configuration
