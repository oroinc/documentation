4.  Enable as many warehouses as you need:

     a) If necessary, click **+Add Warehouse**.
     b) Select the warehouse name in the *Choose a Warehouse* list.
     c) Assign a numeric priority to the enabled warehouse (1 is higher, 100 is lower).
        Products will be ordered and shipped from the higher priority warehouses first.
