Configure All Products Page per Website
=======================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Product Management <concept-guides--product-management>` topic that provides a general understanding of the product concept in OroCommerce.

In your Oro back-office, you can enable and configure the All Products page for the OroCommerce storefront. When configured, such page should display all available products from the master catalog grouped by categories.

Flow
----

To configure the All Products page:

1. Enable **All Products Page** in system configuration on the required level --- :ref:`globally <sys--conf--commerce--catalog--special-pages--global>` or per website (see below).
2. Add it to the storefront as part of either your :ref:`web catalog <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog>` (**Marketing > Web Catalog**) or frontend menu (**System > Frontend Menus**) on the required level:

   * :ref:`Globally <sys--conf--frontend-menus--all-products--global>` (**System > Frontend Menus**)
   * :ref:`Per organization <sys--users--organization--menus--all-products--organization>` (**System > User Management > Organizations**)
   * :ref:`Per website <sys--users--organization--menus--all-products--website>` (**System > Websites**)
   * :ref:`Per customer group <user-guide--customers--customer-groups--all-products>` (**Customers > Customer Group**)
   * :ref:`Per customer <user-guide--customers--customers--all-products>` (**Customers > Customers**)

3. Check the :ref:`example of adding the All Products page <user-guide--all-products--sample>` for your reference.
