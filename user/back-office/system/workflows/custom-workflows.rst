Manage Custom Workflows in the Back-Office
==========================================

Workflows created on the UI from scratch are custom workflows.
Navigate to **System > Workflows** in the main menu to reach the page with all custom and system workflows.
You can perform the following actions for them:

- **Clone**: |IcClone| (copy the workflow to be able to customize it).
- **View**: |IcView| (go to the view page of the workflow).
- **Activate/Deactivate**: |IcCheck| / |IcTimes| (activate/deactivate the workflow).
- **Edit**: |IcEdit| (open the edit form of the workflow).
- **Delete**: |Trash-SVG| (delete the workflow from the system).
