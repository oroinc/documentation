Overview

The Checkout workflow represents a standard checkout procedure in the eCommerce environment.

Step 1: Agreements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the Agreements step, you are required to accept all mandatory consents to process your personal data, if such consents have not been accepted previously. Keep in mind that if you leave the checkout after accepting a mandatory consent, this consent is considered accepted and can be revoked only through the :ref:`profile management <frontstore-guide--profile-consents--revoke>`.

Step 2: Billing Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clicking **Continue** redirects you to the next step.
