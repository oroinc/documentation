Sample Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^

As an illustration, let us go through a sample flow to see RFQ Submission Flow in action:

1. A customer user creates an RFQ in the storefront. Once the RFQ is sent, its customer status is marked as Submitted.

   .. image:: /user/img/system/workflows/rfq/frontoffice/rfq_submission_flow_3.png

2. In the back-office, a sales representative sees the RFQ and requests more information. The RFQ is now in the Requires Attention customer status.

3. The customer user receives the request in the storefront, clicks Provide Information in the right corner of the page and replies to the message. The customer status is now Submitted.

4. The sales representative reads the reply in the Notes section of the RFQ page, marks the RFQ processed and creates a quote from the same page. The RFQ is now in the Processed customer status.
