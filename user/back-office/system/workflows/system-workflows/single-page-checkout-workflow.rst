Configure Single Page Checkout Workflow in the Back-Office
==========================================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Checkout Configuration Concept Guide <checkout-management-concept-guide>` topic that provides the general understanding of single-page and multi-page checkout concepts.

Overview
--------

In your Oro application, you can control the way the checkout is displayed to customers in the storefront. By default, each checkout step is displayed on a new page. However, by activating the Single Page Checkout workflow in the back-office, you can make all steps fit one page. This will make the checkout process easier and quicker for customers, since they will be able to see how far along in the checkout they are, and how many fields are left to complete it.

To reach the Single Page Checkout workflow:

   Within the list of workflows, you can perform the following actions for the Single Page Checkout workflow:

   * View the workflow: |IcView|
   * Activate the workflow: |IcActivate|

2. Click **Single Page Checkout** to open the flow.

   .. note:: If the workflow is active, you can deactivate it from the list page by clicking |IcDeactivate|.

   On the the Single Page Checkout workflow page, you can perform the following actions:

   * Activate --- Click |IcActivate| **Activate** on the top right of the page to activate the workflow.
   * Deactivate (if the workflow is active) -- click |IcDeactivate| **Deactivate** on the top right of the page to deactivate the workflow.
