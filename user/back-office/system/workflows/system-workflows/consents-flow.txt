Checkout with Consents Workflow
===============================

.. contents:: :local:
   :depth: 2

Overview
--------

The Checkout with Consents workflow restricts customer users from proceeding through the checkout if mandatory :ref:`consents <user-guide--consents>` to process personal data have not been accepted. It is a :ref:`system workflow <user-guide--system--workflow-management-system-custom>` that defines the sequence of :ref:`steps and transitions <user-guide--system--workflow-management-steps-transitions>` that a customer user goes through when creating an order in the storefront. When Checkout with Consents is activated, the default :ref:`checkout workflow <system--workflows--checkout-workflow>` is disabled.

As opposed to the standard :ref:`checkout workflow <system--workflows--checkout-workflow>`, the checkout with consents adds **Agreements** as the first step of the checkout in the OroCommerce storefront. As it is impossible to process orders without collecting personal data, such as shipping or billing details, accepting mandatory consents is required to complete checkout and ultimately place the order. When mandatory consents have already been accepted previously (e.g. in the buyer's account, for example), you are not asked to accept such agreements for the second time. 

.. note:: Keep in mind that if you accept a mandatory consent at the **Agreements** step and then abandon the checkout, the mandatory consents are considered accepted and can only be :ref:`declined through the buyer's profile account <frontstore-guide--profile-consents--revoke>`.

Step 1: Agreements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the Agreements step, you are required to accept all mandatory consents to process your personal data, if such consents have not been accepted previously. Keep in mind that if you leave the checkout after accepting a mandatory consent, this consent is considered accepted and can be revoked only through the :ref:`profile management <frontstore-guide--profile-consents--revoke>`.
