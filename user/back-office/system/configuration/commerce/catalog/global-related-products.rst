Configure Global Related Items Settings
=======================================

.. hint:: Read more on this topic in :ref:`Products <doc--products>`.

In the Related Items section, you can configure the system settings for related and up-sell products. These settings may apply globally, per :ref:`organization <sys--users--organization--commerce--catalog--related-products>`, and per :ref:`website <sys--websites--commerce--catalog--related-products>`.

Related products may include accessories, services, and other items that are likely to be purchased in the same order. They facilitate navigation through the product catalog in the back-office and help a buyer find the other products they may be interested in buying.

Up-sell products may advertise more expensive alternatives to the product, like a newer and more advanced model, upgrades and add-ons that may look tempting when bundled with the product, etc.

In the system configuration, you can:

* Enable and disable related and up-sell product management for the products.
* Control the type of the relationship (one-way or bidirectional).
* Limit the number of items displayed as related or up-sell.

.. note:: Before configuring the related items settings, add the required related and up-sell products to the desired products as described in the :ref:`Add Related Items <products--related-items>` topic.


To update the related and up-sell products settings globally:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **System > Configuration**.
2. Select **Commerce > Catalog > Related Items** in the menu to the left.

3. In the **Related Products** section, the following options are available:

   * **Enable Related Products** --- Toggles managing related products on/off. Enabled by default.
   * **Assign in Both Directions** --- When enabled, the products become mutually related. For example, when you add a lightning bulb as a related product for a standing lamp, the relation works both ways and the lamp automatically becomes related item of the lightning bulb. This option is disabled by default.
   * **Maximum Number Of Assigned Items** --- A limit of related products that may be added to any product.
   * **Maximum Items** --- A limit of related products that are shown to a buyer.

     .. note:: Some related products may be hidden by the visibility settings. If the list of related products still exceeds the limit, only the specified number of items (top of the list) will be shown.

   * **Minimum Items** --- The minimum number of related products that may be shown to the buyer. If the actual number of products is less than this value, the related products section is hidden in the storefront for the product.
   * **Show Add Button** --- Enables a buyer to order a related product from the related products section in the main product details. When the option is disabled, a buyer needs to open the related product details before they can add it to the shopping list.

     **Show Add Button is Enabled**
