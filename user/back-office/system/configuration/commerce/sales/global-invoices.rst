Configure Global Invoice Settings
=================================

The Invoices feature enables customer users to view, download, and :ref:`pay invoices <frontstore-guide--invoices>` directly in the OroCommerce storefront. In the back-office, administrators can access and manage invoice records. The feature supports one-click payments for individual invoices. It also provides the ability to import and manage invoices generated by external systems within the OroCommerce interface.

You can configure invoice-related sales globally, per :ref:`organization <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales-invoices-org>`, :ref:`website <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales-invoices-per-website>`, :ref:`customer group <user-guide--customer-group---invoice--settings>` and :ref:`customer <user-guide--customers--invoice--settings>`.

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Sales > Invoices** in the menu to the left.

   .. note::
        For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.
