Configure Global Invoice Settings
=================================

.. important:: The Invoices functionality is partially available as of version 6.1.3 and is still under active development. Some features may not behave as expected. We appreciate your patience as our team continues to enhance and finalize this feature for a full release later in 2025.

The Invoices feature enables customer users to view, download, and :ref:`pay invoices <frontstore-guide--invoices>` directly in the OroCommerce storefront. In the back-office, administrators can access and manage invoice records. The feature supports one-click payments for individual invoices.  It also provides the ability to import and manage invoices generated by external systems within the OroCommerce interface.

You can configure invoice-related sales globally, per :ref:`organization <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales-invoices-org>`, :ref:`website <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales-invoices-per-website>`, :ref:`customer group <user-guide--customer-group---invoice--settings>` and :ref:`customer <user-guide--customers--checkout--settings>`.

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Sales > Invoices** in the menu to the left.

   .. note::
        For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

3. In the **General** section, toggle the following options:

   * **Enable Invoices** ---  enabling this option activates the Invoices feature in the back-office. Once enabled, you can access it via *Sales > Invoices* in the main menu.
   * **Invoice Number Prefix** --- define the prefix to be used when generating invoice numbers (e.g., INV-).
   * **Show Invoices in the Storefront** --- enable this option to display invoices in the storefront.

4. In the **Payments** section, toggle the following options:

   * **Enable Invoice Payments** --- Enables or disables the invoice payment functionality system-wide. When enabled, a Pay button is displayed in the storefront, and a Payments section is added to the invoice view page in the back-office.

   * **Payment Method** --- Specifies the payment method used for invoice payments in the storefront. Currently, only the :ref:`Stripe Integration Element <user-guide--payment--payment-providers-stripe--element>` and :ref:`OroPay <user-guide--payment--oropay>` are supported. Ensure that a Stripe integration or OroPay is configured under *System > Manage Integrations* before selecting it here.
