Registered and unregistered customers can use a quick order form for fast purchases in the Oro storefront. By default, quick order form is enabled, while optimized quick order and guest quick order form are disabled. You can configure the quick form functionality and its options on three levels â€“ globally, :ref:`per organization <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--organization>` and :ref:`per website <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--website>`.

.. note:: Please note that website settings override organization, organization settings override system settings.
