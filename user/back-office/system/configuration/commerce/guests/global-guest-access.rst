Configure Global Website Access Settings
========================================

.. begin

To prevent non-registered customers from accessing the OroCommerce storefront, you can disable website access by non-authenticated visitors. This can be done globally, :ref:`per organization <sys--conf--commerce--guest-access--org>` and :ref:`per website <sys--conf--commerce--guest-access--website>`:

When guest access is disabled:

* New users can register if self-registration is enabled in **Commerce > Customer > Customer Users > Registration Allowed**.
* Guest users can register if self-registration is allowed, even if the website access is closed.
* Guest users cannot access any website pages, except for the login/forgot/reset password page.
* Guest users are redirected to the login page when they try to access the homepage.
