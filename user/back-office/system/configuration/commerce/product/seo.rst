Configure Global SEO Settings (Breadcrumbs Rendering)
=====================================================

To reduce unnecessary visual duplication — especially noticeable on smaller screens — OroCommerce supports removing the current page from the breadcrumbs block on product view and product listing pages.

To manage these settings:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **System > Configuration**.
2. Select **Commerce > Product > SEO** in the menu to the left.

   .. note::
       For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.
