   In the **Cross-Sell Products**, the following options are available:

   * **Enable Cross-Sell Products** --- Toggles managing cross-sell items on/off. Enabled by default.
   * **Maximum Number Of Assigned Items** --- A limit of cross-sell items that may be added to any product.
   * **Maximum Items** --- A limit of cross-sell products that are shown to the buyer.

     .. note:: Some cross-sell items may be hidden by the visibility settings. If the list of cross-sell products still exceeds the limit, only the specified number of items (top of the list) will be shown.

   * **Minimum Items** --- The minimum number of cross-sell products that may be shown to the buyer. If the actual number of products is less than this value, the cross-sell products section is hidden in the storefront for the product.
   * **Show Add Button** --- Enables a buyer to order a cross-sell product from the cross-sell products section in the main product details. When the option is disabled, a buyer needs to open the cross-sell product details before they can add it to the shopping list.

     **Show Add Button is Enabled**
