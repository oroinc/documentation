Cross-Sell Products
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Manage Cross-Sell Products
==========================

Once the core product information is saved, you may configure cross-sell products to show in the **Related Items** section in the product details in the back-office, and in the **Cross-Sell Products** section next to the product details in the storefront.

Use cross-sell products to bind similar products or those that compliment each other, like the item and its accessories.

To add cross-sell products to the product information:

1. Navigate to the **Products > Products** using the main menu.
#. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the item and click the |IcView| **View** icon to preview its details.
#. Navigate to the **Related Items** section and click the |IcEdit| **Quick Edit** link in the section header.

   The **Related Items** page appears.

#. Click **Select Cross-Sell Products**.

#. In the **Select Cross-Sell Products For** dialog:

   a) Select the **Is Related** checkboxes next to the products to mark them as related. Use filter to limit the number of listed products and find the necessary items.

   b) Click **Select Products**.

   This will close the dialog and update the related items list with the products you have selected.

   .. note:: To delete a related item, click |IcDelete| **Delete**  next to it.

#. Once you are done adding the related items, click **Save and Close**.
