Configure Global Settings for Product Images
============================================

On the Product Images configuration page, you can control the following settings:

* `Image Preview on Product Listing Page`_
* `Image Gallery`_


To configure the product image settings globally:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **System > Configuration**.
2. Select **Commerce > Product > Product Images** in the menu to the left.

   .. note::
      For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

3. Customize any of the options by proceeding through the following steps:

     a) Clear the **Use Default** check box next to the option.
     b) Enable the required check box or enter the necessary file size and type information.

4. In the **General** section, configure the following options:

   **Enable Original File Names** --- When enabled, the original image file name will be appended to the system-generated hash value. All non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., ":", ")", ",", "~") will be replaced with "-" (dash).

   For example, the name of the file is **coffee_maker/bosch_#RND123.jpg**, the system-generated hash value is "media/cache/attachment/product_gallery_main/5bae287538.jpg". If the option is enabled, the file name will be displayed in the storefront as follows "media/cache/attachment/product_gallery_main/5bae287538-coffee-maker-bosch-RND123.jpg"
