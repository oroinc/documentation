Configure Global Settings for Product Images
============================================

On the Product Images configuration page, you can control the way images are previewed on product listing pages and configure whether to use popup or inline view for the image gallery.

To configure the product image settings globally:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **System > Configuration**.
2. Select **Commerce > Product > Product Images** in the menu to the left.

   .. note::
      For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

3. To customize the option configuration, clear the **Use Default** checkbox next to the option and select the required value.

4. In the **General** section, configure the following options:

   **Enable Original File Names** --- When enabled, the original image file name will be appended to the system-generated hash value. All non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., ":", ")", ",", "~") will be replaced with "-" (dash).

   For example, the name of the file is **coffee_maker/bosch_#RND123.jpg**, the system-generated hash value is "media/cache/attachment/product_gallery_main/5bae287538.jpg". If the option is enabled, the file name will be displayed in the storefront as follows "media/cache/attachment/product_gallery_main/5bae287538-coffee-maker-bosch-RND123.jpg"

   * **File** — The image file with the watermark on a transparent background.
   * **Size** — The size of the watermark in percentage compared to the whole image.
   * **Position** — The watermark position on the image (e.g., top left, top, top right, left, right, center, bottom left, bottom, and bottom right).
