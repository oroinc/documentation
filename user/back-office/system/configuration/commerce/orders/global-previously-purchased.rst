.. hint:: The previously purchased products page is disabled by default, but you can enable it on three levels, globally, :ref:`per organization <sys--commerce--orders--previously-purchased--org>` and :ref:`per website <sys--commerce--orders--previously-purchased--website>`. Once enabled, you can also set the number of days that the purchase history should cover.

.. note:: Please keep in mind that :ref:`visibility restrictions <products--product-visibility>` may affect the visibility of products for the previously purchased products page. Consequently, if the product is hidden for a specific website, category, customer group, etc., it will not be available on the previously purchased list.
