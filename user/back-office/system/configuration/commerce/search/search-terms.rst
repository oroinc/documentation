3. Configure the following options:

   * **Enable Search History Feature** --- enables the :ref:`Search History feature <user-guide-search-search-history>`  that helps track your customers' searching activity, including the products users have searched for, the number of products found, etc. Additionally, the option enables :ref:`a Search Terms report <user-guide-search-terms-report>` that collects statistics on how many times a particular search term was used, the number of times that search term returned products, and the number of times it returned an empty result.

   * **Enable Global Search History** - enables the system to collect all statistics about the customers' search queries. Keep in mind that enabling this option may result in a large number of records being saved to the database on popular websites, so be careful when enabling this feature.

4. Click **Save Settings**.
