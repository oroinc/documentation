Configure Global Customer Recommendations Settings
==================================================

.. note:: The feature is only available in the Enterprise edition applications.

.. note:: You can also configure customer recommendation search settings :ref:`on the website level <website-configuration--commerce--search--customer-recommendation>`.

You can boost full-text search results based on the history of all registered customers that have interacted with your website. Such boost settings help provide customers with a better user experience, displaying the most relevant products based on customer actions (product views, product placement to a shopping list, product purchases) or total product revenue.

To configure the product full-text search boost settings based on the global purchase history, the total revenue, or the product data only:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Select **Commerce > Search > Customer Recommendations** in the menu to the left.

.. note:: For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.
