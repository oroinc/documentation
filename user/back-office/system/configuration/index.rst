Global Configuration Settings
=============================

Settings under the **System > Configuration** menu enable you set up your Oro application specifically to your business needs. Settings located here are :ref:`system-wide (or global) <doc-system-configuration>`. Configuring these settings globally means that they are by default applied throughout all organizations, websites and users in your system. This is the base configuration level and you can customize some of its options :ref:`per organization <doc-organization-configuration>`, :ref:`website <doc-website-configuration>`, or :ref:`user <doc-my-user-configuration>` later on. Selected settings are also available on :ref:`customer group <user-guide--customer-groups--customer-settings>` and :ref:`customer <user-guide--customers--customer-settings>` levels.

Based on the level where configuration has taken place, settings can fall back to other levels following the pattern below:

* :ref:`User settings <doc-my-user-configuration>` fall back to the :ref:`organization settings <doc-organization-configuration>`.
* :ref:`Website settings <doc-website-configuration>` fall back to the :ref:`organization settings <doc-organization-configuration>`.
* :ref:`Organization settings <doc-organization-configuration>` fall back to the :ref:`system settings <configuration--guide--system--configuration>`.
* :ref:`Customer Group settings <user-guide--customer-groups--customer-settings>` fall back to the :ref:`website settings <doc-website-configuration>`.
* :ref:`Customer <user-guide--customers--customer-settings>` settings fall back to the :ref:`customer group settings <user-guide--customer-groups--customer-settings>`.
