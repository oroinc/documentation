Configuration Quick Search
==========================

Quick Search enables you to find the particular item you are looking for in a fast and simple way by performing a smart search with a minimum typing.

The **Quick Search** function narrows down your query and provides a quick navigation between the menu items by specifying keywords, phrases, or field values.

You can search for configuration options in the back-office on any level:

1. Globally --- Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.

2. Per organization --- Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

3. Per website --- Navigate to **System > Websites** in the main menu. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary website and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

4. Per user --- Navigate to **System > User Management > Users** in the main menu. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary user and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

5. Per customer group — Navigate to **Customers > Customer Groups** in the main menu. Hover over the **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary group and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

6. Per customer — Navigate to **Customers > Customers** in the main menu. Hover over the **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary customer and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

As an example, let us find the **Localization** menu via the **Quick Search** field. The menu resides under **System Configuration > General Setup** in the left panel.

To find the menu, proceed with the following steps:

1. Start typing *localization* in the **Quick Search** field.

2. Only the items with the *localization* in their titles will be displayed and highlighted upon your request.
