Configure Global Google Settings
================================

All Oro application editions support the integration with Google. With its help, you can configure Google single sign-on to enable users with the same Google account email address and OroCRM/Commerce primary email address to log in only once in a session. Additionally, you can configure OAuth2 with Google for email synchronization, and set up Google Hangouts calls.

.. hint:: Read more on this topic in :ref:`Google Integration <admin-configuration-google>`.

To configure Google integration-related settings in the back-office:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. In the panel to the left, click **System Configuration > Integrations > Google Settings**.
