MS Outlook Settings
-------------------

.. important:: The Outlook integration is deprecated and therefore no longer maintained. The integration will be removed in version 4.1.

.. begin_outlook_integration_oro

Once you downloaded and installed the add-in, you can configure MS Outlook settings on the Oro side. These settings include:
 
 * **MS Outlook add-in settings**
 * **Integration settings**
 * **Synchronization settings**

.. hint:: MS Outlook settings can be configured globally, :ref:`per organization <org-outlook-settings>`, and :ref:`per user <user-outlook-settings>`, with the exception of MS Outlook add-in settings, which can only be managed globally.

Configure MS Outlook Add-in Layout Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the add-in is installed, a side bar panel appears on the right side of the Outlook window which displays the actions that can be performed in Outlook and synchronized back to Oro (e.g. create a lead). Depending on the synchronization settings set up between the applications, you can create leads, opportunities, and cases from within MS Outlook using the side bar, and then sync them back to Oro.

The layout of this sidebar, as well as the lead, opportunity, and case dialogs, can be changed by amending the default XAML code (or providing a new one) in the MS Outlook Add-in Settings on the Oro side.

.. .. image:: /user/img/system/config_system/addin_view.png

To change the layouts:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Click **System Configuration > Integrations > MS Outlook Settings** in the panel to the left.
3. On the MS Outlook settings page, clear the **Use Default** check box for the required option (e.g. Side Bar Panel Layout).
4. Modify the default XAML code to alter the layout.
5. Click **Save Settings**.

.. note:: For the changes to take effect, remember either to start sync manually, or wait until automatic sync finishes.

Configure Integration Settings
