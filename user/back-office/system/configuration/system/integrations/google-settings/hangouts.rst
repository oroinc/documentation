Configure Voice and Video Calls via Hangouts in the Back-Office
===============================================================

.. warning:: Google has retired Google Hangouts and associated services, and this integration is no longer supported.

Oro applicationâ€™s integration with Google Hangouts enables you to make Hangouts voice or video calls from within your Oro application, providing an advantage for sales and support teams by helping them connect with customers directly. You can make voice calls to a single phone number, or launch a audio/video conference with up to 5 participants. Call data is logged automatically, including any notes made during the call.
 
For the integration between Hangouts and your Oro application to be successful, make sure you:

* Have an active Google account (if you try using the feature when not logged in, you will be prompted to log-in) 
* If you are using a browser other than Chrome, install a Google Hangout or Google Talk extension for the browser.
* If you are going to call phone-numbers beyond USA and Canada, make sure you have funds in your Google Wallet.

Configure the Integration 
-------------------------

.. note:: Google Hangouts are configured globally and :ref:`per organization <user-guide-hangouts-org>`.

To enable the integration in the Oro application on the global level:
 
1. Navigate to the **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Click **Integrations > Google Settings** in the panel to the left.
3. In the **Google Hangouts** section, select the following checkboxes:
 
   * **Enable for Emails** --- to call via email (you can invite up to 5 users to a Google Hangout by emailing them)
   * **Enable for Phones** --- to make phone calls
