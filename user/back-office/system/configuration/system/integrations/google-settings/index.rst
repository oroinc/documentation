Configure Global Google Settings
================================

All Oro application editions support the integration with Google. With its help, you can configure Google single sign-on to enable users with the same Google account email address and OroCRM/Commerce primary email address to log in only once in a session. Additionally, you can configure OAuth2 with Google for email synchronization and Google Tag Manager settings.

.. note::

    * Google integration settings can be configured globally,

    * Google Tag Manager is configured globally, :ref:`per organization <organization-google-settings>`, and :ref:`website <website-google-settings>`.

To configure Google settings on the system level:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.
2. In the panel to the left, click **System Configuration > Integrations > Google Settings**.
