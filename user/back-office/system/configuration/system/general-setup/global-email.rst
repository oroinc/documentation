Configure Global Email Settings
===============================

You can configure email settings on four levels -- globally, :ref:`per organization <admin-configuration-email-configuration-organization>`, :ref:`per website <admin-configuration-system-mailboxes-website>`, or :ref:`per user <admin-configuration-email-configuration-user>` with the system settings on the global level containing the highest number of options. Based on the level where configuration has taken place, settings can fall back to other levels.

.. note:: See a short demo on |how to create and manage emails| and |how to synchronize your mailbox with an Oro application| or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.

Configure a System Mailbox
--------------------------

System mailbox allows people who do not have access to the company mailbox addresses write to the company.

You can create several system mailboxes. For example, this can be a mailbox for support requests, business proposals, or order requests.

You can define and modify the list of Oro users who have access to each of these mailboxes, automatically turn letters into cases or leads, and set-up auto-responses.

You can create a system mailbox on two levels, globally and :ref:`per organization <admin-configuration-system-mailboxes-organization>`.

.. note::
   See a short demo on |how to create and configure system mailboxes| in your Oro application, or continue reading the step-by-step guidance below.

To configure a system mailbox globally:

1. Navigate to **System > System Configuration** in the main menu.
2. Click **System Configuration > General Setup > Email Configuration** in the panel to the left.
3. In the **System Mailboxes** section, click **Add Mailbox**.
4. In the **General** section, define the basic settings of the mailbox:

   * **Mailbox Label** --- Provide a name for the system mailbox.
   * **Email** --- Provide the email address.

5. In the **Synchronization Settings**, configure your IMAP/SMTP connection or a Microsoft 365 account:

   .. note:: Please be aware that if the Account Type value has changed, a new mailbox will be registered, and all data from the currently configured mailbox will be lost. However, if the Account Type value has changed from or to the **Other** type, a new mailbox will *not* be registered, and all data from the currently configured mailbox will stay. This helps migrate existing mailboxes from the basic IMAP configuration to Microsoft or Gmail.

   * **Account Type: Gmail** (is available when the application is integrated with Google and :ref:`OAuth 2.0 for email sync <admin-configuration-integrations-google-gmail-oauth>`  is enabled.)

     * *Connected Account* --- The account connected to Gmail. Click **Retrieve Folders** to load folders from the connected account.

   * **Account Type: Office 365** (is available when the application is integrated with :ref:`Microsoft 365 OAuth <user-guide-integrations-azure-oauth>`)

     * *Connected Account* --- The account connected to Microsoft 365. Click **Retrieve Folders** to load folders from the connected account.

     * *Password* --- Provide your password

    Click **Check Connection/Retrieve Folders**. After successful connection, a list of available folders is displayed. Select the check boxes next to the folders you wish to synchronize. In the example below, synchronization has been done for a Gmail mailbox. The INBOX folder will be synchronized.

6. In the **Email Processing** section,  choose what happens to all the emails received in the mailbox.

   * *Do Nothing* --- No actions are performed. Letters are saved in the mailbox.
   * *Convert To Lead* --- Letters will be saved in the mailbox. Based on the first letter in the thread, a new Lead record will be created in OroCRM.
   * *Convert To Case* --- Letters will be saved in the mailbox. Based on the first letter in the thread, a new Case record will be created in OroCRM.

   As an example, we have selected the **Convert To Lead** option. Once the action has been selected, define which user will own the records and choose the source of your leads in the **Source** field.

7. In the **Access Management** section, define which users will have access to the system mailbox. You can select :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` and/or specific users. All the users with defined roles and all the specifically defined users will have access to this mailbox.

8. In the **Autoresponse Rules** section, generate one or several auto-response rules. These rules determine which template is sent to the sender of the email.

9. Click **Add Rule** to add a new auto-response rule and complete the following details in the dialog:
