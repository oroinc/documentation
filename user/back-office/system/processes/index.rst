Configure Processes in the Back-Office
======================================

Some actions in the Oro application trigger other actions. This behavior is pre-defined at the background and can be modified in the course of the system integration.
For example, as soon as a new customer has been uploaded to the Oro application, an account and a record are automatically created for it, and if a new campaign has been created in a Dotdigital address book synchronized with a marketing list in Oro, a new email campaign record is automatically created in OroCRM/OroCommerce.

You can view and activate/deactivate the process in the Oro application UI.

View Processes
--------------

To view the processes, navigate to **System > Processes** in the main menu.

The All Processes grid contains the following details:

  * **NAME** --- Defines the process available in the system.
  * **RELATED ENTITY** --- Entity which records are influenced by the process.
  * **EXECUTION ORDER** --- Priority of the process execution. The smaller is the number, the higher is the priority. If several processes have been triggered simultaneously, the processes with a higher priority are executed first.
  * **ENABLED** --- If set to *Yes*, the process will be executed.
  * **CREATED AT** --- Date and time when the process was added to the system.

From the grid, you can |IcView| view, |IcActivate| activate or |IcDeactivate| deactivate the process by clicking the corresponding icon.

On the process's details page, you can see the basic process details (as in the grid) and the **Process Triggers**, i.e., in what case and with what delay after the event the process will be executed.
