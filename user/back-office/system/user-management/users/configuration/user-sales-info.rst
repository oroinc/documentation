Configure Settings for Contacts per User (Sales Rep Information)
================================================================

.. note:: User settings override all other settings if **Customer Owner** or **Customer User Owner** are selected as a display option.

To locate user configuration settings, navigate to **My User > My Configuration** and click **Commerce > Sales > Contacts** in the panel on the left.

.. note::
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

In the **Customer Visible Contact Info** list in their user configuration settings, the user will see the options that are enabled and selected in **Available User Options** on the system, website or organization levels.

Depending on the configuration, the **Customer Visible Contact Info** list may include one or more of the following options:

* Don't Display Contact Info -- do not display any sales rep information.
* Enter Manually -- display contact information that is manually entered in the *Enter Contact Info* field.
* Use System -- fallback to system settings. The option is available only when the **Display** setting in the system configuration is set to *Pre-Configured*.
* Use My Profile Data - display the user profile details as a contact information.

User settings override all other settings only if **Customer Owner** or **Customer User Owner** are selected as display options. 

.. note:: To fall back to organization settings, enable the **Use Organization** checkbox.

In the **Enter Contact Info** field, provide custom text to be displayed. This text is used as a contact information only when the **Customer Visible Contact Info** setting is set to *Enter Manually*.
