Here, you can configure the following options by clearing the **Use Organization** checkbox and providing your own data:

4. In the **Location Options** section, provide:

   * **Primary Location** and **Format Address Per Country** --- Define the address formatting to be applied.

     If *Format Address Per Country* is enabled and the country-specific formatting is enabled for the instance, the address will be displayed in compliance with the rules specified for the country.
     For example, if the chosen country is China, the address is displayed as follows:

     * *ZIP code*
     * *Country*
     * *State, City*
     * *Street*
     * *First and Last name*

     whereas, for the US it is:

     * *First and Last name*
     * *Street name*
     * *CITY NAME, STATE CODE, COUNTRY, ZIP code*

     Otherwise, the *Primary Location* formatting is applied.

   * **Timezone** --- Defines the timezone to be applied for all the time settings defined in the instance. If the time-zone is changed, all the time settings (e.g. due dates of :ref:`tasks <doc-activities-tasks>`), time of reminders, etc. change correspondingly. The default value is(UTC -08:00) America/Los Angeles.

5. In the **Map Settings**, select the **Temperature Unit** and **Wind Speed Unit** to display the weather on the map. The default values are Fahrenheit and miles per hour (MPH).
