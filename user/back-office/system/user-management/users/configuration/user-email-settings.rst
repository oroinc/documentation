                  2. Click **My Configuration**.
                  3. Follow the steps described below.

Settings
--------

On the **Email Configuration** page, define options applied to all the emails in the application.

.. note:: To change any of the system-wide options, clear the **Use Organization** checkbox first.

1. **Signature** --- Add a signature to the emails.

   * *Signature Content* --- Specify the text and formatting of your signature. Bby default, the email signature body is empty.
   * *Append Signature to Email Body* --- Define whether a signature must be added automatically or manually.

2. **Email Synchronization Settings** --- provide details to configure your personal mailbox. Select one of the options below:

   .. note:: Please be aware that if the Account Type value has changed, a new mailbox will be registered, and all data from the currently configured mailbox will be lost. However, if the Account Type value has changed from or to the **Other** type, a new mailbox will *not* be registered, and all data from the currently configured mailbox will stay. This helps migrate existing mailboxes from the basic IMAP configuration to Microsoft or Gmail.    

   * **Account Type: Gmail** is available when the application is integrated with Google and :ref:`OAuth 2.0 for email sync <admin-configuration-integrations-google-gmail-oauth>`  is enabled.

     * *Connected Account* --- The account connected to Gmail. Click **Retrieve Folders** to load folders from the connected account.


   * **Account Type: Office 365** is available when the application is integrated with :ref:`Microsoft 365 OAuth <user-guide-integrations-azure-oauth>`.

     * *Connected Account* --- The account connected to Microsoft 365. Click **Retrieve Folders** to load folders from the connected account.

   * **Account Type: Other**:

     * *Enable IMAP* --- Select the checkbox to enable retrieving email messages
     * *IMAP Host* --- Provide the IMAP Host, e.g. imap.gmail.com
     * *IMAP Port* --- Provide the IMAP Port, e.g. 993
     * *Encryption* --- Select the encryption type, SSL or TLS.
     * *Enable SMTP* --- Select the checkbox to enable sending messages
     * *SMTP Host* --- Provide the SMTP host, e.g. smtp.gmail.com
     * *SMTP Port* --- Provide the SMTP port, e.g. 587
     * *Encryption* --- Select the encryption type, SSL or TLS.
     * *User* --- Provide your email address
     * *Password* --- Provide your password

     Click **Check Connection/Retrieve Folders**. After successful connection, a list of folders will be loaded. Check the folders that you wish to be synchronized (e.g., Inbox).

     As an example, we have synchronized a Gmail mailbox with OroCRM, having previously turned on **access for less secure apps**. More details on how to synchronize your Gmail and turn on access for less secured apps can be found in the |Use IMAP to check Gmail| and |Less secure apps & your Google Account| topics.
