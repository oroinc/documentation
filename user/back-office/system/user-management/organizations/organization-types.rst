Organization Types
==================

.. important:: Organization types are only available in the Enterprise edition.

An organization type represents a set of predefined :ref:`restrictions and limitations provided by a developer <dev-organization-types>`.

In the Oro applications, an organization type can be assigned to an organization when creating or editing an organization.

By default, all organizations are assigned to the **General** organization type, which means that an organization is allowed access to all functionality without any restrictions or limitations.
