Organization Types
==================

.. important:: Organization types are only available in the Enterprise edition.

An organization type represents a set of predefined :ref:`restrictions and limitations <dev-organization-types>` for a particular organization. Developers can add additional types, if required.

In the Oro applications, an organization type can be assigned to an organization when creating or editing an organization.

By default, there are two types of organizations, **General** and **Marketplace Seller**. With **General** organization type, an organization is allowed access to all functionality without any restrictions or limitations. Organizations with type **Marketplace Seller** will have restrictions as to what functionality vendors can access.
