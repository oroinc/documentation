   * **Number of Products in Search Autocomplete** --- Maximum number of products shown in the storefront autocomplete dropdown.
   * **Number of Categories in Search Autocomplete** --- Maximum number of categories shown in the storefront autocomplete dropdown.
   * **Allow Partial Product Search** --- When enabled, the customer can find a product in the global search and on quick order form using a substring inside a word. Enabling this option may have a performance impact on search behaviour.
