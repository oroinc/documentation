4. Customize any of the options by proceeding through the following steps:

   a) Clear the **Use System** check box next to the option.
   b) Enable the required check box or enter the necessary file size and type information.

5. In the **Product Fulltext Search** section, configure the following options:

   * **Number of Products in Search Autocomplete** --- Maximum number of products shown in the storefront autocomplete dropdown.
   * **Allow Partial Product Search** --- When enabled, the customer can find a product in the global search and on quick order form using a substring inside a word. Enabling this option may have a performance impact on search behaviour.

6. Click **Save Settings**.
