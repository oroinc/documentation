Configure Quick Order Form Settings per Organization
====================================================

Registered and unregistered customers can use a quick order form for fast purchases in the Oro storefront. By default, quick order form is enabled, while guest quick order form is disabled. You can configure the quick form functionality on three levels â€“ :ref:`globally <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--global>`, per organization, and :ref:`per website <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--website>`.

3. Select **Commerce > Sales > Quick Order Form** in the menu to the left.
