Configure Quick Order Form Settings per Organization
====================================================

Registered and unregistered customers can use a quick order form for fast purchases in the Oro storefront. By default, quick order form is enabled, while optimized quick order and guest quick order form are disabled. You can configure the quick form functionality on three levels â€“ :ref:`globally <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--global>`, per organization, and :ref:`per website <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--quick-order-form--website>`.

.. note:: Please note that website settings override organization, organization settings override system settings.

To configure the quick order form for registered and unregistered users per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.
2. For the necessary organization, hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click |IcConfig| to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Sales > Quick Order Form** in the menu to the left.

.. note::
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.
