Configure Website Routing Settings per Organization
===================================================

To change the default currency settings per organization:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu.

2. For the necessary organization, click the |IcMore| **More Options** menu at the end of the row, and then click the |IcConfig| **Configure** icon to start editing the configuration.

3. Select **System Configuration > Websites > Routing** in the menu to the left.

   .. note:: For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

4. Remove the **Use System** to deselect the **Prefer Self-Contained Web Catalog Canonical URLs** option for the organization. When this option is disabled, the canonical URLs point to the direct URLs of the underlying content types if they are available. This option is enabled by default.
