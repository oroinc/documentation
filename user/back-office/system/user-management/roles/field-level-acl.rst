Configure Field Level Permissions in the Back-Office
====================================================

Overview
--------

Entity fields are used to store details of entity records in |oro_application|. When you need to hide certain fields from one group of users and still have them available for others, you can apply field-level permissions to entities when creating or editing roles in |oro_application|. 

For example, both the sales team and the support team require to see **Opportunity** entity records, but because financial information is considered sensitive, you can hide the **Budget Amount** field from the support team members. 

.. important:: Out of the box, field-level permissions can be applied only to the account, opportunity and custom entities.

The following table illustrates the actions that can be performed to entity fields: 

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action | Description                                                                   |
+========+===============================================================================+
| View   | A user can see entity record fields and values.                               |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Create | A user can see and modify entity record fields on the 'new entity' form.      |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Edit   | A user can see and modify entity record fields on the 'edit entity' form.     |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For each of these actions you can set the required access level. However, the set of available access levels for entity fields depends on:

* The ownership type of an entity. For example, you cannot set the **User** access level for a field if the ownership type of the entity is **Organization**. 

* The action. For the **Create** action, only the **None** (access is denied) and **Global** (access all entity records within the system) access levels are available independently of the entity's ownership type.

The ability to assign permissions for entity fields enables you to configure user roles in |oro_application| according to the needs of your company. However, the configuration you apply needs to make sense. For example, if you set the **None** access level to the **View** action of all fields but leave the user an ability to view entity records, they will see only blank lines in the record table and on the record page itself. That is why, if you want to restrict a user from viewing entity records, make sure to set the **None** access level to the **View** action for the entity itself.  

.. note:: When restricting users from viewing particular fields, make sure to restrict them from editing these fields, too.

Enable Users to See Restricted Fields 
-------------------------------------

You can enable users to modify only certain entity fields and restrict them from modifying others. For example, you can enable sales managers to modify opportunity statuses, but restrict sales representatives to only viewing them with no permissions to update statuses in any way. Fields disabled for editing will appear dimmed on the interface.
