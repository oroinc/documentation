Configure Entity and System Capabilities in the Back-Office
===========================================================

.. note:: The Entity and System Capabilities topic is part of the section on :ref:`Understanding Roles and Permissions <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>`, and provides the list of capabilities that you can enable or disable when creating or modifying roles in |oro_application|.

Access to different capabilities in the back-office depends on the capabilities enabled for a specific user role. In the application, these capabilities are grouped under categories, such as accounts management, orders or system capabilities. An example of a capability is enabling a selected user to manage menus or passwords.

You can enable or disable entity-specific and system-specific capabilities in the **Entity** section when creating or updating a role in your application, as illustrated below:

.. warning:: Keep in mind that capabilities available in your instance depend on the Oro application installed (for example, OroCRM has fewer capabilities than OroCommerce).
