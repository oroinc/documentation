2. Click **Create Group** on the top right.

3. In the **General** section, provide the following information:

   * **Owner** --- The owner of the group represents a business unit whose members can manage the group subject to the :ref:`access and permission settings <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`. 
   * **Name** --- The name used to refer to the user group on the interface.

4. In the **Users** section, select the **Has Group** check box next to the required users to add them to the group you are creating. 

   .. note:: One user can belong to more than one group.

5. Click **Save and Close**.

Once saved, the group is available on the list of all groups under **System > User Management > Groups**, where you can filter groups by name, edit and delete them.
