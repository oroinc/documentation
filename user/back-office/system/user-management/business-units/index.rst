Configure Business Units in the Back-Office
===========================================

A :term:`business unit <Business Unit>` represents a group of users with similar business or administrative tasks/roles.

For instance, one toy company with three toy shops can be set up as the main organization with three child business units created under it, one for each toy store. Permissions could be used to restrict access for these business units.

.. note:: If strict data isolation is needed between business units, it makes sense to use the :ref:`multi-organization <user-ee-multi-org-system>` approach (available for the Enterprise edition only).

.. note:: See a short demo on |how to create organizations and business units| or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.

6. Click **Save and Close**.

Once saved, the business unit is available on the list of all business units under **System > User Management > Business Units**, where you can filter business units by name, view, edit and delete them.
