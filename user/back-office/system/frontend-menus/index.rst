Configure Storefront Menus in the Back-Office
=============================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Storefront and Back-Office Menu Management Concept Guide <menu-management-concept-guide>` topic that provides the general understanding of the available storefront and back-office menu types and their management in Oro applications.

In this section, you will learn how to edit and configure the storefront menu components in OroCommerce.

All the OroCommerce storefront menus are located in the main menu under **System > Frontend Menus**.

Each menu type has a different purpose that is described in detail in the :ref:`Storefront and Back-Office Menu Management Concept Guide <menu-management-concept-guide>`.

Permissions Required to Customize Storefront Menus
--------------------------------------------------

The ability to configure menus globally, per organization, and for personal use is controlled by the two capabilities: **Manage Menus** and **Access system configuration**.

By default, only users with Admin role have these capabilities enabled and may customize menus on all configuration levels.

To enable a user to personalise menus for themselves and configure menus for each organization individually, include the **Manage Menus** capability into the user role.

To enable a user to configure menus globally, for all organizations, websites, and users whose configuration fall back to the global settings, both **Manage Menus** and **Access system configuration** capabilities should be enabled for the user role.
