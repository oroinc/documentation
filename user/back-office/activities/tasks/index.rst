In your Oro application, tasks represent assignments that need to be accomplished by a user. Keeping track of tasks helps organize the work process and ensure that all the important work is done.

Within the Oro application, you can create and assign tasks, organize them by priority, set their due date, and manage them at any stage. In the sections below, you will learn how to create and manage tasks from various pages of your Oro application.
