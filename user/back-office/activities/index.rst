Manage Activities in the Back-Office
====================================

Activities are the various actions that employees of a company perform on a daily basis. These can include fulfilling job tasks, communicating with colleagues and customers, or participating in events. In the Oro application, you can efficiently manage all of these activities and link them together to create a comprehensive view of all communications.

The capabilities for managing activities in Oro are extensive and mainly cover three key areas: workflow management, communications, and adding valuable remarks.

You can link related records to each activity. For instance, this may include a link to an email discussion that led to the activity. These links are referred to as **contexts**, and they significantly simplify the process of keeping track of all the details associated with each activity.

.. note:: Please note that the ability to view and edit activities is dependent on the specific roles and permissions defined within the system.

* :ref:`Tasks <doc-activities-overview-tasks>`
