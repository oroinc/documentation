Manage Marketing Campaigns in the Back-Office
=============================================

Marketing Campaign records in Oro application are used to capture general details of the campaign and monitor key metrics. Metrics can include leads generated, pages visited, or any other metrics necessary to quantify results of the marketing effort.

You can include any number of :ref:`Email Campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns-plus-marketing>` and :ref:`Tracking Website records <user-guide-marketing-tracking>` into one campaign and get the full picture to evaluate the campaign efficiency.

This article describes the ways to create, manage, and view the campaign records.

.. _user-guide-marketing-campaigns-create:

Create a Campaign Record
------------------------

To create a new marketing campaign:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Campaigns** in the main menu.

2. Click **Create Campaign** in the top right corner to get to the *Create Campaign* page.

      :alt: The Create Campaign page

3. In the **General** section, provide the following information:

   * **Owner** --- Limits the list of users that can manage the campaign to users, whose roles allow managing campaigns of the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.).

   * **Name** --- The name is used to refer to the campaign in the system.

   * **Code** --- A unique code of the campaign that is used to generate its tracking settings. May contain only alphanumeric symbols, dashes, and underscores.

   * **Start Date** --- This field is optional.

   * **End Date** --- This field is optional.

   * **Description** --- This field is optional.

   * **Budget** --- This field is optional.

   * **Report Scale** - Defines the default time scale of the events graph. Provides the schedule for the consumer to prepare the reports. You can choose between the hourly, daily or monthly options.

  .. note:: Keep in mind that usually the consumer takes some time to run the job queue. However, if you want to check the performance immediately, you can enable :ref:`dynamic tracking <admin-configuration-tracking>` in the system configuration under **System > Configuration > System Configuration > General Setup > Tracking**. By default, this option is disabled, as this behavior is preferred for the production environment. But for testing purposes, you can enable this option to bypass the consumer and log visits and other events as soon as they occur.

.. note:: Custom fields may be added, subject to specific business needs.

4. Once you finish configuring the marketing campaign, click **Save and Close** in the top right corner of the page.

.. _user-guide-marketing-campaigns-view-page:

View the Marketing Campaign Details
-----------------------------------

To view the details of any marketing campaign:

#. Navigate to **Marketing > Campaigns** in the main menu.

#. Click the selected marketing campaign to preview its content.

The details page is divided up into three sections: General, Events, and Tracking code.

In the **General** section, you can see the campaign plan or configuration (name, code, schedule, budget, etc.).

.. image:: /user/img/marketing/marketing/marketing_campaign_view_general.png
   :alt: View the details of a marketing campaign in the general section

The **Events** tab contains the list of campaign events. Here, you will see the events summary chart and detailed events report collected from the related marketing sources. Each event represents one point of action when a user has accessed a predefined part of the website following the campaign. Recurring access is logged as a separate event.

Campaign events include the events logged for related :ref:`Email Campaigns <user-guide-email-campaigns-plus-marketing>` and :ref:`Tracking Website records <user-guide-marketing-tracking>`.

.. image:: /user/img/marketing/marketing/marketing_campaign_view_events.png
   :alt: The list of campaign events in the Events tab

In the example above, users accessed the site 25 times, twelve times out of these times they added products to the shopping list, one time they clicked a banner, and fifteen times they clicked the phone button.

In the **Tracking Code** section, you will find two tracking codes generated specifically for the selected marketing campaign. Those are a URL parameter and a push code.

.. _user-guide-marketing-codes:

Compare a URL Parameter and a Push Code
---------------------------------------

The URL parameter and the push code provide you with different options to log a visit. They may be incorporated into the URL or the script on the website page.

**URL Parameter**

The first option is a URL parameter:

.. code-block:: html


      ?pk_campaign=btwogonefree

It is used when you have a tracking website, and you want to calculate the events for multiple campaigns and from different sources, such as an email link, Youtube, social media, paid ads or organic search visits. It should be added to the URL of the website you want to monitor. The event is logged only when a user reaches the website via the specific link with this parameter (for example, *sample-site.net?pk_campaign=btwogonefree*).

In the **Events** section on the campaignâ€™s page, you will see all the events logged under this campaign.

.. image:: /user/img/marketing/marketing/events_logged.png
   :alt: A list of events logged under the campaign

The idea behind the URL parameter is that each campaign is assigned its own unique URL. So if you run several campaigns on one website, you can easily track each event back to its source campaign by changing the parameter.

**Push Code**

The second option is a push code:

.. code-block:: html


      _paq.push(['setCampaignName', 'btwogonefree']);


This code is used when you run only one marketing campaign on your website, so all user interactions within your website should be uniquely assigned to this particular campaign regardless of the source the visitors used to reach your website.

In this case, you need to insert this push code into the javascript code of your website (after the **setUserId** call) so that all user activities are assigned to this particular campaign no matter which sources visitors used to reach your website.

.. code-block:: html


    <script type="text/javascript">
        var _paq = _paq || [];
        _paq.push(['setUserId', 'guest' ]);
        _paq.push(['setCampaignName', 'btwogonefree']);


No matter which code you choose, a URL Parameter or a Push Code, the results will be displayed in the report.

You can export this report at any time by clicking the **Export Grid** button.
