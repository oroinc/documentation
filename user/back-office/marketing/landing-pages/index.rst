On a landing page, you can:

* Describe a service or product in a compelling way that leads to the informed buying decision and moves your customer one step closer to the purchase.

* Share a promo (e.g., use a promo code to get 10% discount off the *Winter items*).

* Offer an ebook download, webinar registration, or notification of a new product line launch in exchange for registering an account in your eCommerce website.

Create a Landing Page
---------------------

To create a new landing page:

#. Navigate to **Marketing > Landing Pages** in the main menu.

#. Click **Create Landing Page**.

#. Fill in the landing page title (**Titles**) and translate it into the languages supported in your Oro configuration.

   To manage title translations, click |IcTranslations| next to the **Titles** box and follow the guidance :ref:`here <localization--localization>`.

#. Click on the Slug Prototypes box. The default slug prototype will be autogenerated. Edit the value to customize the default.

   To ensure that slug prototype translation is localization-friendly, manage slug prototype translations: click |IcTranslations| next to the **Slug Prototypes** box and follow the guidance :ref:`here <localization--localization>`.

#. Enter the landing page content in the WYSIWYG text editor. Drag the selected element (a text, an image, a column, or a source code) from the editor's manager panel and drop it to the required location. Rearrange the content or modify the style of the elements by navigating from tab to tab in the WYSIWYG editor's manager bar.

   .. note:: You can insert the *Contact Us widget* into the required page. For this, enter ``{{widget('contact_us_form')}}`` in the text editor and click **Save** in the top right corner. Once the landing page is added as a content variant to the content node of a web catalog, the form should then become visible in the storefront.

#. In the SEO section, manage the meta description and meta keywords that will be incapsulated in the landing page.

   Meta information helps search engines index and display the landing page in the search results when it becomes relevant.

   Meta description would summarize the page contents in one or several sentences (~160 characters).

   Meta keywords are comma separated words and phrases that describes the content in the most precise and relevant way that help find the page via the search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.)

#. Once you have completed editing the new landing page details, click **Save** on the top right of the page.

The new landing page is created and is available by the following URL:

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:

    <OroCommerce application URL>/<slug prototype>/

For example, *http://acme.orocommerce.com/online-webinar-jan2017/*

.. note:: You can also create a landing page from the web catalog configuration page following the guidance described in the :ref:`Add a Landing Page <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content-variant-landing page>` topic.

**Next steps**

Use the landing page URL in your marketing activities (email campaigns, advertisement, etc).

#. Find the line with the necessary landing page and click on it. You can preview the landing page detailed information.

Manage Landing Page Drafts
--------------------------

The landing page functionality enables you to create drafts, save them, and publish selected drafts when you are ready.

.. note:: The ability to manage drafts depends on the :ref:`permissions and access levels <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>` defined for a user of the selected role.

To create a draft of the required landing page:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Landing Pages** and click on the selected landing page.

2. Click |IcCopy| **Create draft** on the top right.

3. An action confirmation popup displays the fields that are to be copied from the selected landing page to its draft (e.g., content, titles, metaTitles, metaDescriptions, metaKeywords). Click **Yes** to proceed and edit the draft.

   Be aware that you do not need to edit the URL Slug. Once the draft is published, it keeps the URL Slug of the original landing page and not a new slug that you may create for the draft.

4. Edit the information as required and select one of the further actions:

  * **Save and Close** -- saves the current draft. You can find it under the **Drafts** section of the selected landing page.
  * **Save as new draft** -- saves the draft as a new one without affecting the current draft. For example, you are editing *Draft 2*, and instead of applying the changes to *Draft 2*, you want to save your draft as a new one and called it *Draft 3*. When saved, *Draft 2* remains unchanged, and *Draft 3* is added to the list of the landing page drafts.
  * **Cancel** -- cancels the draft creation.
  * **Delete** -- deletes the draft.

5. To view the saved drafts, navigate to the **Drafts** section of the required landing page. Click the desired draft to get to its details page. Alternatively, hover over the |IcMore| **More Actions** menu to |IcEdit| edit, |IcDelete| delete, |IcCopy| duplicate, or |IcPublish| publish the draft.

6. To publish the draft, click |IcPublish| **Publish draft** on the top right of the draft's details page. Once the action is confirmed, the draft is published, substituting the original landing page. All the drafts previously created for this landing page are then deleted.
