Manage Content Widgets in the Back-Office
=========================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Content Management Concept Guide <concept-guide-content-management>` topic that provides a general understanding of the tools that help manage the content of your website, such as web catalog, landing page, content blocks, widgets, and WYSIWYG editor.

Content widgets are snippets of structured information that you can insert into any WYSIWYG field in your application. :ref:`WYSIWYG fields <getting-started-wysiwyg-editor-field>` are available throughout OroCommerce; for example, in category descriptions, on edit pages of products, content blocks, and landing pages.

There are four content widget types:

* An Image Slider
* A Contact Us form
* A Product Mini Block
* A Product Segment

Each of these widget types has a different set of options.

Please keep in mind that:

Create a Content Widget
-----------------------

To create a new content widget:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Content Widgets** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Content Widget** on the top right.

   .. note:: If you have more than one organization in your OroCommerce application, first select which organization to add a new content widget to.

3. Depending on the widget type, form fields are different:

   * **Contact Us Form** - Enables you to add a standard Contact Us form.

   * **Product Segment** - Enables you to add a product segment content widget, configure how many max and min items to show, whether to use slider on mobile, and show the **Add to Shopping List** button in the storefront. Only segments with type *Product* are listed in the **Segment** field dropdown. You can modify an existing :ref:`segment <user-guide--business-intelligence--filters-segments>` or create a new one under **Reports&Segments > Manage Segments**.

   .. hint:: Each content widget may have various representations in the form of layouts. Developers define layouts using the existing :ref:`layout update functionality <dev-doc-frontend-layouts-layout>`, which enables you to alternate between the pre-configured designs for each widget in the back-office.

             .. image:: /user/img/marketing/content_widgets/layout-dropdown.png
                :scale: 50%
                :align: center
                :alt: Select Layouts in the back-office

             Please be aware that layouts are theme-specific. For more information, please refer to the :ref:`CMS bundle documentation <how-to_create-content-widget-type>`.
