Create a Sample Coupon
----------------------

.. begin

As an illustration, let us create a sample promotion and generate 100 coupons. These coupons will be redeemed for orders placed by first-time customers. The promotion will offer a 20% discount for all orders between 1 March and 31 May 2026.

Create a Promotion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As coupons must be linked to promotions, the first step is to create a new promotion:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Promotions > Promotions** in the main menu.
2. Click **Coupons Actions > Create Promotion** on the top right.
3. In the form that opens, specify the discount details and items, making sure that the **Triggered by** field is set to *Coupons and Conditions*.
   The sample promotion is called **Spring Sale**, and the discount options are 20% off all orders.

2. Click **Coupons Actions > Generate Multiple Coupons**.
