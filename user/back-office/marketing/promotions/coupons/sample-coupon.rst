Create a Sample Coupon
----------------------

.. begin

As an illustration, let us create a sample promotion and generate 100 coupons. These coupons will be redeemed for orders placed by first-time customers. The promotion will offer a 50% discount for all orders between 18 and 22 May 2019.

Create a Promotion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As coupons should always be linked to promotions, the first step is to create a new promotion:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Promotions > Promotions** in the main menu.
2. Click **Coupons Actions > Create Promotion** on the top right.
3. In the form that opens, specify the discount details and items, making sure that the **Triggered by** field is set to *Coupons and Conditions*.

   The sample promotion is called **Summer Sale**, and the discount options are 50% off all orders.

4. Click **Save and Close**.

Generate Coupons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, generate coupons for this promotion:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Promotions > Coupons** in the main menu.
2. Click **Coupons Actions > Generate Multiple Coupons**.
3. In the pop-up that opens, specify the details of the coupons, making sure that the **Coupon Quantity** is set to *100* and the coupons are linked to the newly created *Summer Sale* promotion.

3. Click **Add Coupon Code** on the top right of the order page.
4. Select the coupon from the list, click **Add** and then  **Apply**.
