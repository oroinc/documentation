Calculate Order Total in Promotions
-----------------------------------

We are going to illustrate how price calculations work in Oro using the example below, where the rounding precision is set to 2:

.. csv-table::
   :align: center
   :header: "Product", "Price", "Quantity"
   :widths: 10, 10, 10

   "TAG3", "$1.0149", "3"
   "TAG2", "$3.0209", "1"

1. **Row Totals**
 
   Row totals are calculated for each line item, then summarized and rounded for the subtotal amount.
   
   The calculated subtotal is:

   .. code-block:: none

      round (1.0149*3 + 3.0209*1) = round (6.0656) = 6.07$.

.. WIP But now we are working on a fix that moves rounding from subtotal to row totals. See pull request with this fix, for same example, the calculated subtotal will be: round(1.0149*3) + round(3.0209*1) = round(3.0447) + round(3.0209) = 3.04 + 3.02 = 6.06$

2. **Order Discounts**

   When order discounts (i.e :ref:`Special Discounts <user-guide--sales--orders--promotions--add-special-discount>`) are used, the line item subtotal calculated previously is used.

   For example, if we add a 10% order discount (on the order edit page in the back-office), the calculated discount subtotal is:

   .. code-block:: none

      round (6.07/10) = round (0.607) = 0.61$

3. **Promotion Discounts**

   If you use promotion discounts, their calculation may be different depending on the promotion :ref:`discount type <user-guide--marketing--promotions--create>`.

   The following is an example of a complex promotion with the Order Line Item discount:

   * Type = Percent
   * Discount Value = 20%
   * Apply Discount to = Each Item
   * Max Quantity = 2
   * For TAG3

   .. image:: /user/img/marketing/promotions/sample_for_order_calculation.png
      :alt: View the promotion discount options configured based on the conditions from the example

   In this case we take the price for one item, multiple by the percent value and the maximum quantity, and then summarize all discounts from promotions, and round the subtotal. The calculated discount subtotal is:
 
   .. code-block:: none

      round((1.0149-10%) * 0.2 * 2 (maximum quantity in 3 existing)) = round(0.365364) = -0.37$

4. **Shipping Cost**

   Flat Rate Shipping Cost + $10.00

6. **Taxes**

   10% sales tax +0.61$ (round((1.0149*3 + 3.0209*1) * 10%) = round(0.60656) = 0.61$)

7. **Grand Total**

   .. code-block:: none

      6.07 - 0.61 - 0.37 + 10 + 0.61 = 15.70$.
