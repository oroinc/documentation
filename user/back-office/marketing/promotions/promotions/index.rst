Manage Promotions in the Back-Office
====================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Promotion Management <concept-guides--promotion-management>` topic that provides the general understanding of the promotions and coupons concept.

Companies often develop loyalty programs offering special discounts to customers who have bought from the company before, follow them in social networks, or have commented on their website. This can motivate customers to buy more and repeat purchases from their stores, making :term:`promotions <Promotion>` one of the most effective strategies when it comes to converting shoppers to buyers.

* Configure promotions
* Apply various discount options for orders or line items
* Build a strategic schedule for promotions
* Set visibility restrictions to target specific customers
* Add and generate :ref:`coupons <user-guide--marketing--promotions--coupons>`
* Manage discounts in placed :ref:`orders <user-guide--sales--orders>` and view them in :ref:`shopping lists <user-guide--sales--shopping-lists>` in the back-office.
