In the All Promotions grid, you can click any promotion to view its details, hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the required promotion to |IcClone| duplicate, |IcView| view, |IcEdit| edit, or |IcDelete| delete it from the system.

2. To create a new promotion, click **Create Promotion** in the top right corner.

3. In the **General** section, complete the following fields:

   * **Owner** --- Select the user responsible for the promotion from the list, or click |IcBars| to load the list of users to choose from. By default, the current user in predefined as the promotion owner.
   * **Name** --- Specify the promotion name to distinguish it from other promotions.
   * **Sort Order** --- Enter the sort order to set the priority compared to other available promotions. The lower is the number, the higher is the priority.
   * **Enabled** --- Enable the checkbox to activate the promotion. To deactivate it, clear the checkbox.
   * **Stop Further Rule Processing** --- Select this option if you wish to prevent applying other promotions with lower priority.

      For instance, if there are three promotions for the same products with sort orders 1, 2 and 3 respectively, and the promotion with sort order 2 has **Stop Further Rule Processing** enabled, then when the turn reaches such promotion, the queue stops and promotion with sort order 3 is not applied.
   * **Triggered by** --- Select :ref:`Coupons and Conditions <user-guide--marketing--promotions--conditions>` if the promotion is going to use :ref:`coupons <user-guide--marketing--promotions--coupons>`, and :ref:`Conditions only <user-guide--marketing--promotions--conditions>` if it is not.

4. In the **Discount Options** section, configure the discount calculation.

   a) In the **Discount** list, select the level that the discount targets:

      * *Order Total* --- The discount applies to the total order amount,
      * *Order Line Item* --- The discount applies to the line item total,
      * *Buy X Get Y (Same Product)* --- The price of certain quantity of the line items (up to Y) may be discounted when they are ordered in bulk (more than X), or
      * *Shipping* ---  The discount applies to shipping.

   b) In the **Type** list, select whether the discount type should be represented by a fixed amount (e.g. - 10USD) or a certain percent (5%) off the item price.

      .. note:: Please note that when a fixed discount is used, the promotion applies to the order in the selected currency only.

   c) In the **Discount Value**, provide the required discount amount and select the currency (if possible).

      .. note:: Please note that Oro Application Community version supports one currency. You can set up multiple currencies that would be available for selection in the Discount Value field only in the Enterprise version of the application.

   d) Depending on the discount type, the remaining fields in the **Discount Options** section will differ. See the following sections for their detailed description:

      * `Discount Options for Order Line Item`_

      * `Discount Options for Buy X Get Y (Same Product)`_

      * `Discount Options for Shipping`_

5. In the **Schedules** section, specify the following dates:

   a) **Active at**  --- Schedule the date and time when the promotion should trigger.
   b) **Deactivate at** --- Schedule the date and time when the promotion should end.

   .. note:: To add more schedules, click **+Add**.

6. In the **Conditions** section, provide the following information:

   a) **Restrictions** --- Set visibility restrictions to promotions. By default, promotions are displayed for any customer or customer group. Only one field must be chosen at a time, either a customer group and a customer.
   b) **Expression** --- Specify the :ref:`expression <user-guide--promotion--expression>` that describes the :ref:`conditions <user-guide--marketing--promotions--conditions>` when the promotion should be applied. You can also use expressions to evaluate customers by a particular attribute, such as free shipping only if the customer purchases a qualifying amount of product, or a particular item is in their cart.

7. In the **Items To Discount** section, add, filter or reset the product that the promotion should apply to:

   a) **Reset Products** --- Click **Reset Products** next to the tabs to clear all filters and reset the product collection to the default state.
   b) **Add** --- Click **Add** to add the selected products manually. This can be used in cases when you have few products to be added and there is no need to set up a complicated filter, or when you need to add specific products that may be out of the filterâ€™s scope. Manually added items will appear both in the *Manually Added* and *All Added* tabs.

      .. note:: To ensure that specific items are excluded from the list of the product collection and will not be included automatically or manually, click **Add** in the *Excluded* tab. All removed products will move to the *Excluded* tab automatically. Make sure that you have not previously excluded the item that you want to add to the promotion, as excluded products do not appear on the list.

   c) **Advanced Filter** --- Add a product via a :ref:`filter <user-guide-getting-started-filters>` to limit the product list and include only the necessary products. Advanced filter is hidden by default. Click **Preview Results** to check whether the products found via the filter match your criteria, or to exclude unnecessary items from the list.

      .. note:: You may use filter on the top of the dialog to limit the scope of the products and make it fit into the visible area.

8. In the **Store Frontend** section, you can specify the label (e.g. the promotion name) in the Labels field that will be displayed in the Order Summary section of the checkout in the storefront (illustrated below) alongside the coupon code. If left blank, the name of the promotion linked to the coupons will be used as the label.

Discount Options for Order Line Item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create a line item promotion that will discount each line item. 

.. note:: You can check out a video on |how to create a line item promotion| in our media library.

For the line items discount, provide the following information:

* **Unit of Quantity** --- Select the necessary unit type from the list (e.g. each, item, set.). Note that the discount will only apply to the product with a specified unit type.

* **Apply Discount to** --- Select whether to apply discount to each of the items on sale or for the line items total.

  For instance, if there are 10 items in the shopping list that qualify for a discount and the discount is $1 per item, then the discount will constitute $10. If in the same scenario the promotion should apply to the line items total, then the total discount will constitute $1.

* **Maximum Qty Discount is Applied to** --- Enter the maximum quantity of products of the same type eligible for discount in a line item/order. For example, when the limit is set to 10 and a buyer orders 100 items, they will be charged the discounted price for 10 items out of 100, and will pay the full price for the remaining 90 items.

  .. note:: Please note that the **Maximum Quantity Discount is Applied to** field can only be applied if the **Apply Discount to** field is set to *Each Item*.

Discount Options for Buy X Get Y (Same Product)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buy X Get Y promotions mean that the buyer purchases qualifying X products and receives a discount off the same products. For instance, buy one get one free, or buy one get one 5$ off.

.. note:: You can check out a video on |how to create the Buy X Get Y (Same Product) promotion| in our media library.

For the Buy X Get Y (Same Product) discount, provide the following information:

* **Apply Discount to** --- Select one of the options, *Each Y Item Separately* (the discount will apply to Y items only) or *X+Y Total* (the discount will apply to the total of X and Y items).

  For instance, if:

  * There are 10 items in the shopping list that qualify for a promotion.
  * Buy X is set to 3.
  * Get Y is set to 2.
  * The discount is $1 per each

  Then:
