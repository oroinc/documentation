Manage Content Templates in the Back-Office
===========================================

.. hint:: Content Templates are available starting from OroCommerce v5.0.6. To check which application version you are running, see the :ref:`system information <system-information>`.

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Content Management Concept Guide <concept-guide-content-management>` topic that provides a general understanding of the tools that help manage the content of your website, such as web catalog, landing page, content blocks, templates, widgets, and WYSIWYG editor.

Content templates are small chunks of complex markup that you create to reuse later in content blocks, landing pages, or in other entities with WYSIWYG field.

When it comes to creating columns with texts and images, videos, and buttons, users may face difficulties arranging them properly on the page. To simplify work with the WYSIWYG editor, advanced users can design custom content templates (patterns), which they can later insert into any desired location of the page and modify fonts and styles, align the content, and alter the text.

.. warning:: Do not confuse the Content Templates and Content Blocks features.

   :ref:`Content block <concept-guide-content-blocks>` is a block of content, pre-designed and preconfigured for users to embed it as is. You cannot make adjustments per page. If the content block is changed, the changes are applied everywhere the block is used.

   Content templates, on the contrary, can be altered everywhere they are placed without affecting other pages that reuse this template.


Create a Content Template
-------------------------

To create a content template:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Content Templates** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Content Template** on the top right.

3. Provide the following details:

* **Owner** - the owner of the content template.
* **Name** - the name of the content template.
* **Enabled** - select the checkbox to activate the content template.
* **Tags** - the tag that is associated with the content template. You can either enter your own tag or select from the existing ones. Keep in mind that all content templates are grouped by tags in the WYSIWYG editor to speed up the search. You can find them under the Content Templates' WYSIWYG tab. The templates without a tag are assigned to the General section.

4. Use WYSIWYG to design the template you need.

5. Click **Save and Close**.

Once saved, the system automatically generates the content template preview, which you can also view in the All Templates' grid. There, you can select which content template to view |IcView|, edit |IcEdit|, clone |IcClone|, or delete |IcDelete|.

.. hint:: Once you save the content template, you can now place it in the required location in the WYSIWYG field. For more details on how to insert content templates into WYSIWYG, see the :ref:`WYSIWYG Editor <wysiwyg-editor-add-content-template>` topic.
