#. In the **General** section, provide the following information:

   * **Owner** --- Limits the list of users who can manage the opportunity to users whose :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>` allow managing opportunities assigned to the owner (e.g., the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.). By default, the user creating the record is selected as the owner.
   * **Lead Name** --- The name used to refer to a lead in the system.
   * **Status** --- Three statuses are available for a lead:

     - **New** - a newly created lead.
     - **Qualified** - a lead is recognized as valid as a result of the initial analysis (e.g., an interested person or organization behind the lead).
     - **Disqualified** - a lead is recognized as invalid as a result of the initial analysis, e.g., no person or organization was found behind the lead).

   * **Channel** --- Choose one of active :term:`channels <Channel>`, from which OroCRM will get information on this lead.

   The rest of the fields are optional.

#. In the **Contact Information** section, provide contact details to be entered for a lead. You can enter multiple emails, phones, and addresses for a lead.
