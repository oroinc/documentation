#. In the **General** section, provide the following information

   * **Owner** --- Limits the list of users who can manage the opportunity to users, whose :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions-roles>` allow managing opportunities assigned to the owner (e.g. the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.). By default, the user creating the record is chosen.
   * **Lead Name** --- The name used to refer to a lead in the system.
   * **Status** --- Three statuses are available for a lead:

     - **New** - a newly created lead.
     - **Qualified** - a lead is recognized as valid as a result of initial analysis, e.g. there is an interested person or organization behind the lead).
     - **Disqualified** - a lead is recognized as invalid as a result of initial analysis, e.g. no person or organization was found behind the lead).

   * **Channel** --- Choose one of active :term:`channels <Channel>`, from which OroCRM will get information on this lead.

   The rest of the fields are optional.

#. In the **Contact Information** section, provide contact details to be entered for a lead. You can enter multiple emails, phones and addresses for a lead.
