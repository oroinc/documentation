Grid Views

Inline Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inline editing within the grid can help you amend lead details without opening the edit lead form. To edit leads from the grid, double-click on the field or the edit icon in the field you wish to edit.

Lead View
---------

The lead page contains all available information on the lead in the **General Information** section. The **Activity** section shows all activity for a lead that has taken place, such as phone calls or emails sent to the lead.

   .. note:: You can disqualify a lead in three ways:

              1. By clicking on the red **Disqualify** button on the lead view page.

              2. By changing its status to Disqualified in the edit lead form.

              3. By changing its status to Disqualified from the grid.

-  **Convert to Opportunity:** Converting a lead to opportunity (i.e., and potential deal) qualifies the lead. You can find more information on opportunities in the :ref:`opportunities topic <user-guide-system-channel-entities-opportunities>`.

   .. note:: Once the lead is converted to an opportunity, it is marked *Qualified* and will no longer be visible in the Open Leads grid.

-  **Delete:** Delete a lead from the system.
-  **More Actions:** Add Note, Send Email, Add Event, Log Call, or Add Task.
