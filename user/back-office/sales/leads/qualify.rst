Qualify a Lead
==============

Every lead can be qualified into an opportunity, or disqualified, if it is clear that the deal is not going to progress.

When the lead is converted to an opportunity, a contact is automatically created based on lead data, so contact details are still kept in the system for future reference or business intelligence needs. If the potential success level is high from the very start, you can create an opportunity straight away skipping the creation of a lead.

You can qualify leads either using the actions on the lead page, or using the steps and transitions of the enabled system **Unqualified Sales Lead** workflow. This workflow represents alternative user experience and sequence of the lead qualification process, and is by default disabled.

.. note:: The Unqualified Sales Lead workflow is a system workflow and cannot be edited or deleted.
