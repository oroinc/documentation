Qualify a Lead
==============

Every lead can be qualified into an opportunity or disqualified if it is clear that the deal will not progress.

A contact is automatically created based on lead data when the lead is converted to an opportunity. Contact details are kept in the system for future reference or business intelligence needs. If the potential success level is high from the very start, you can create an opportunity straight away, skipping the creation of a lead.

You can qualify leads using the actions on the lead page or the steps and transitions of the enabled system **Unqualified Sales Lead** workflow. This workflow represents an alternative user experience and sequence of the lead qualification process and is by default disabled.

.. note:: The Unqualified Sales Lead workflow is a system workflow and cannot be edited or deleted.
