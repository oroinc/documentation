Manage Leads in the Back-Office
===============================

Leads enabled you to save and process the details of commercial activity with people or businesses that have authority, budget and interest to purchase goods and/or services from you, for whom the probability of actual sales is not yet high or is impossible to define. Essentially, :term:`leads <Lead>` are prospects or potential sales in a form of contact data. Initial agreement discussions, preliminary price requests or invitations for a bid may be examples of a lead.

.. note:: See a short demo on |how to create and work with a lead| or keep reading the step-by-step guidance below.
