7. In the **Shipping Information**, configure the default shipping option pre-selected for the customer on the checkout:

   .. a) In the **Shipping Methods** list, tick the boxes next to the shipping methods that you would like the customer use for this order delivery.

   a) In the **Shipping Methods** list, select the recommended (default) shipping method that will be pre-selected when the customer gets to the shipping configuration on the checkout.

   .. .. note:: When none of the methods are selected, the customer can use any of the listed methods.

   .. .. note:: Once you change the existing settings, the previous configuration will be saved for your information in the previously Selected Shipping Method log above the list of the shipping methods.

   .. b) If necessary, select the preferred shipping method from the **Default Shipping Method** list. The customer will be able to change the option to any other available shipping method.

   b) Optionally, enter the **Overridden Shipping Cost Amount, USD** - a custom shipping cost that will be used instead of the one dynamically generated based on the shipping method selection.

   c) To enforce using only the default Shipping method selected earlier, enable the **Shipping Method Locked** flag. When the shippig method is locked, the buyer does not see any other payment options but the default one.

   d) Tick the **Allow Unlisted Shipping Methods** box to allow using the shipping method that is already selected as a default one, even if it is disabled by the shipping rule configuration.

8. Optionally, select a **Payment Term** as an available payment method.

9. Click **Save**.

Once the quote is created, you can send it to the customer who can further negotiate or convert it to order and proceed to the checkout.
