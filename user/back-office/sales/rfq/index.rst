Manage Request for Quotes (RFQ) in the Back-Office
==================================================

.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`RFQ and Quote Management <concept-guide-rfq-quotes>` topic that provides a general understanding of the RFQ and quote concepts in OroCommerce.

:term:`RFQs (Requests for quotes) <Request for Quote>` are used by sales representatives to assist customers and meet their needs through negotiations on a better price, more convenient quantities of products, or additional services. Once a customer submits a request for a quote in the Oro storefront, it immediately becomes available in the Oro back-office.

Before starting your work with RFQs, make sure that you have:

1. **Configured RFQ-related workflows** --- activate or deactivate the RFQ :ref:`workflows <doc--workflows--actions--system>` that control the interactions between the storefront and the back-office. These workflows help buyers, and sales managers run the process automatically and provide the corresponding status upon this interaction.

2. **Configured RFQ notification options** --- :ref:`configure RFQ notification options <sys--conf--commerce--sales--rfq-notifications--general>` to ensure that both the customers and the sales representatives receive email notifications on submitting a new RFQ.

3. **Configured guest RFQs** --- to let unregistered customers request quotes on the items they are interested in, you can enable :ref:`guest RFQ forms <user-guide--system-configuration--commerce-sales--rfq>` in your Oro application.
