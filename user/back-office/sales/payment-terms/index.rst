Manage Payment Terms in the Back-Office
=======================================

Use payment terms configured per customer to help them use the payment conditions guaranteed by their contract with your company.

A payment term is a set of conditions required for a sale to be completed, e.g., the period that is allowed for a buyer to pay off the amount due. Payment terms may also include cash in the advance requirement, cash collection on delivery, a deferred payment period of 10/20/30 days, etc.

.. hint:: **To use payment terms in the storefront:**

            1. :ref:`Enable Payment Terms Integration <sys--integrations--manage-integrations--payment-term>` in the system configuration.
            2. `Create a Payment Term`_ with the conditions you would like to offer your buyers.
            3. `Link a Payment Term to a Customer Based on Their Sales Agreement`_ (optional).
            4. :ref:`Create a payment rule <sys--payment-rules>` and add your integration to it to display this method to the customers at checkout.
