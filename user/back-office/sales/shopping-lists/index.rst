Manage Shopping Lists in the Back-Office
========================================

:term:`Shopping lists <Shopping List>` are similar to shopping carts in most online stores. However, shopping lists have additional features. These include the ability to:

* Manage multiple shopping lists simultaneously.
* Request quotes from a shopping list.
* Submit orders from a shopping list.
* Create as many shopping lists as needed.

Via the back-office, you can access any shopping list created and saved by the customers in the OroCommerce storefront.

.. important:: See a short demo on |creating orders from the shopping list|.

View Shopping List Details
--------------------------

To view a specific shopping list in the back-office:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Shopping Lists** in the main menu.

2. Find the required shopping list and click on it to open its details page.

3. In the **General** section, you can find the shopping list ID, the customer user who has created the shopping list, and the comments, if any.

4. In the **Shopping List Line Items** section, you can review the details of line items added to the shopping list (products, quantity, unit) and notes to the line items, if any.

   You can perform the following actions to the items by hovering over the more options menu:

   * |IcView| View complete details of the product that is added to the shopping list.
   * |IcEdit| Modify details of the product added as a line item to the shopping list.
   * |IcDelete| remove the line item from the shopping list.

   .. note:: To handle a significant volume of data, use page switcher, increase *View Per Page*, or use filters to narrow down the list to the information you need.

5. The **Totals** section displays the aggregated amounts, like subtotal, tax, discount, and the total amount due for payment of the items in the shopping list. OroCommerce automatically recalculates these amounts when new items are edited in, added to, or removed from the shopping list.
