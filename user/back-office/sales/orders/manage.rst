The following information about orders is available:

* **Order Number** --- The unique order reference number. It is generated automatically for new orders.
* **PO Number** --- Another order reference number. It is usually defined by the buyer and used by the buyer's side to match the invoice and the received goods with the purchase.
* **DNSLT** (Do not ship later than) --- The date on which the order expires.
* **Currency** --- The currency in which the order is made.
* **Subtotal** --- The amount due for items included in the order. Does not include additional costs, taxes, or discounts.
* **Total** --- The final amount due for the order. Includes all the additional costs (like shipping costs), taxes or discounts.
* **Customer** --- The customer that made the order.
* **Customer User** --- The customer user that made an order on behalf of the customer.
* **Internal Status** --- The order status is visible only in the back-office. See the :ref:`description of internal statuses <doc--orders--statuses--internal>`.

.. hint::

   To manage the columns displayed within the grid, click |IcConfig| on the right of the grid and select the information you wish to be displayed.

   To handle the significant volume of data, use page switcher, increase the 'view per page' value, or use |IcFilter| filters to narrow down the list to the needed information.

   .. For more information on configuring visible fields, the number of items per page, etc., see the :ref:`Grids <doc-grids>` topic.

At the top right, you can see the name of the view. The views are defined by default:

* Open Orders --- Shows only orders with the status 'Open'.
* All Orders --- Shows all existing orders regardless of their statuses.

To change the view, click the drop-down next to the view name and select the required view.
