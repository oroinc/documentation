Add a Shipping Tracking Number to the Order
-------------------------------------------

When a customer user submits an order, they provide the shipping address and, optionally, the *Do Not Ship Later Than* date. They may see the shipping cost estimate based on this information and their selected shipping method. After a salesperson adds the shipping service and their tracking number to the order, the customer user can track the delivery (if the shipping company provides this option).

To add a piece of tracking information about the shipping to the order:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Orders** using the main menu.

#. Click on the necessary order to view its details.

#. Click **Shipping Tracking**.

   Some orders may be delivered in multiple portions due to the circumstances related to the delivery time or delivered volume.

   To provide tracking details for additional shipping, click **+Add** and enter the method and tracking number.

#. Click **Save**.

After the tracking information for shipping has been provided, it becomes available to the buyer in the storefront.
