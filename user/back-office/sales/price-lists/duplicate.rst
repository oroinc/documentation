Duplicate a Price List
======================

To save you time from manually re-entering prices, you can create a new price list from the existing one by duplicating it.

To duplicate the existing price list:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Price Lists** in the main menu.
2. Click once on the price list in the table to open its details page.
3. On the price list page, click **Duplicate Price List**.

   .. note:: You can duplicate existing price lists if you are granted the corresponding ACL permissions. Read more on roles and permissions in the :ref:`Understand Roles and Permissions <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` topic.
