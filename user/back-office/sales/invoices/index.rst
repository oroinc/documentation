.. _user-guide--sales--invoices:

Manage Invoices in the Back-Office
==================================

.. note:: The Invoices functionality is partially available as of version 6.1.3 and is still under active development. Some features may not behave as expected. We appreciate your patience as our team continues to enhance and finalize this feature for a full release later in 2025.

The Invoices feature enables customer users to view, download, and :ref:`pay invoices <frontstore-guide--invoices>` directly in the OroCommerce storefront. In the back-office, administrators can access and manage invoice records. The feature supports one-click payments for individual invoices.  It also provides the ability to import and manage invoices generated by external systems within the OroCommerce interface.

When the invoice functionality is :ref:`enabled in the system configuration <configuration--guide--commerce--configuration--sales-invoices>`, you can view customer's invoices under **Sales > Invoices** in the main menu.

In the invoices grid, you can open an invoice to view it, or delete it.

On the invoice view page, you can view the invoice details, line items, payments associated with the invoice, as well as download it as a .pdf file, or add a note to it.

As invoices are related to orders, you can access the original order the invoice was generated for. Similarly, you can view invoices associated with the orders on the order view page under the *Invoices* tab.

.. hint:: The ability to pay the invoice in the storefront is controlled by the :ref:`Stripe Integration Element <user-guide--payment--payment-providers-stripe--element>` and :ref:`OroPay <user-guide--payment--oropay>` in the back-office.
