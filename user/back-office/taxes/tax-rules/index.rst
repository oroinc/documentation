.. hint:: This section is part of the :ref:`Tax Management <concept-guide--taxes>` concept guide that provides a general understanding of the tax configuration and management in OroCommerce.

Tax rules help OroCommerce find the correct tax rate that should be used for the products listed in the purchase order by matching the product tax code that indicates:

* Tax status of the product
* Customer tax code that indicates the tax status of the buying company
* Tax jurisdiction where the tax is due

The sections below provide guidance on how to create and manage tax rules.
