.. container:: scroll-table

   .. csv-table::
     :header: "Customer Tax Code Code","Product Tax Code Code","Tax Jurisdiction Code","Tax Code"
     :widths: 15, 15, 15, 20

     "NON_EXEMPT","TAXABLE_ITEMS","LOS_ANGELES_COUNTY","LOS_ANGELES_COUNTY_SALES_TAX"

To import a bulk of tax rules information:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **Taxes > Tax Rules**. The tax rule list opens.

2. Click **Import File** on the top right.

3. **Prepare data for import**: Create your bulk information in the .csv format. Once your file is ready, click **Choose File**, select the prepared comma-separated values (.csv) file, and click **Import File**.

.. note:: Ensure that your .csv file is saved in the Unicode (UTF-8) encoding. Otherwise, the content of the file can be rendered improperly.

5. **Launch import:** After successful validation, click **Import File**.

6. Click **Cancel** to decline the import.

.. important:: Interactive status messages inform about the import progress, and once the import is complete, the changes are reflected in the list upon refresh. Additionally, an email message with the import status is delivered to your mailbox.

Follow the on-screen guidance for any additional actions. For example, for the inventory template, select one of the options: a) inventory statuses only or b) detailed inventory levels.
