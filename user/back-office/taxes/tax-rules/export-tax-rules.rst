Export Tax Rules
----------------

.. start

You might need to export the necessary tax rule details, download it as a .csv file, and reuse it in the third-party systems.

Another scenario for using export is when you plan bulk data update that is easily automated in the spreadsheet software.

To export the tax rules in a .csv format:

1. In the main menu, navigate to **Taxes > Tax Rules**.
2. Click **Export** on the top right.
3. Once the export is complete, you will receive an email to download the .csv file.
