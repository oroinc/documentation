Integration with External Tax Management Systems
------------------------------------------------

In many cases, some of the buyers may be exempt from paying taxes or additional import fees, or a certain product may not receive any sales tax. For instance, in many countries, medical equipment can be purchased and imported tax-free.

To take these circumstances into account when a customer is submitting an order, you should configure your tax calculation in OroCommerce to comply to the existing rules. To simplify this process, companies who use tax compliance software and services, such as Avalara or Vertex, can enable integration with these systems in OroCommerce and retrieve tax rates from those systems instead of the internal tax rules.

.. note:: Avalara and Vertex are tax compliance management applications that help your company automatically keep up to date with the laws in each country or region in which you do business, calculate and apply any exemptions, and keep track of them for your own accounting department.
