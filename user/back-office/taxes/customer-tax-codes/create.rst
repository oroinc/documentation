Create a Customer Tax Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. begin

A customer tax code is a label for a group of customers that indicates the tax obligations and exemptions that a customer has. These tax obligations are considered when a customer submits an order.

To create a new customer tax code:

#. Navigate to **Taxes > Customer Tax Codes** in the main menu.

#. Click **Create Customer Tax Codes**.

#. Fill in **Owner**, **Code**, and **Description** with information about the customer tax code you are creating.

#. Click **Save and Close**.

.. stop

.. hint::

   Now that the customer tax code is created, link it to :ref:`a customer <user-guide--taxes--link-a-tax-code-to-a-customer>` and :ref:`create a tax rule <tax-rules-create>` that associates the customer tax code with the tax rate or tax exemption (zero rate).
