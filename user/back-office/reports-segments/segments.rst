Manage Segments in the Back-Office
==================================

Segments are dynamically filtered subsets of the data (e.g., product collection, marketing list). To use a set of records in reports, filters, web catalog nodes, or marketing lists, you can create a segment and reuse it instead of copying the same query as a condition.

Segment combines a set of records filtered using the query that may use the following information as the foundation:

* Activity
* Data audit
* Field Condition
* Segment
* Condition Group

Dynamic segments refresh automatically. Segments of manual type require explicit refresh by clicking **Refresh** |IcRefresh|.

   #) *Optionally*, add a **Description** to help you and other users understand the segment's purpose or peculiarities in the future.

   #) Select the primary entity that segment should look up.

   #) Select the segment type from the list. **Dynamic** segments are updated as soon as any changes have occurred in the system. **Manual** segments are updated only following the manual refresh action when viewing the segment details.

   #) Optionally, specify the records limit. The segment shows the first X results in case the limit is provided.

   #) Select the segment owner - a business unit, members of which can manage the segment, subject to the roles defined in the system.

#. In the *Designer > Columns* section, define the set of the fields of the entity records to be shown in the segment.
