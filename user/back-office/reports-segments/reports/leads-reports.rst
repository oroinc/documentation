Leads Reports
=============

Oro applications provide ready-to-use **Leads by Date** and **Leads by Geography** reports.

**Leads by Date** report shows how many leads were created on a specific date for all channels.

To see the report, navigate to **Reports and Segments > Reports > Leads > Leads By Date.**

Leads by Date report shows:

-  The date leads were created on
-  The number of the leads created on a specific date

In the :ref:`global organization <user-ee-multi-org>`, lead details are displayed per organization. Organizations without global access can view lead details specific to their organization only.
