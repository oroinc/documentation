Manage System and Custom Reports in the Back-Office
===================================================

In Oro applications, you can create reports based on the details of any entity available in the system.

You can get easy-to-understand adjustable reports on the budgets and activity of different
customers, on statuses of carts and the current state of actual and potential sales, on the performance of your
:ref:`marketing effort <user-guide-marketing>`, specifics of recent :ref:`activities <user-guide-activities>`, etc.

There are several out-of-the-box reports, such as :ref:`Leads by Date <doc-leads-reports>` and
:ref:`Opportunities by Status <user-guide-opportunities-reports--opportunities-by-status>`, but you can also create your custom reports.

System reports are read-only. You can view the report output and filter the resulting data.
