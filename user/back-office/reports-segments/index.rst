Manage Reports and Segments in the Back-Office
==============================================

Oro applications come with flexible reports and segmentation engines. Reports enable you to create reports on any metric, giving you insights into your business performance, while segmentation helps you identify buyer segments to understand what customers buy, when they buy, and how they buy.

Data analysis tools help you make informed decisions related to your sales and commerce activities:

* Use out-of-the-box system reports, on-demand customizable reports, and flexible data segments to drill down into the data.
* Base your sales, marketing, and commerce activities (e.g., pricing, email campaigns, etc.) on the latest information and statistics via inline filters and segments.
