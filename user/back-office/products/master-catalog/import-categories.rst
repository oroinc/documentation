The columns you need to pay attention to are the following:

* **id** --- the ID of the existing category. IDs are generated by the system. Do not specify any ID for the new categories you want to import. Once imported, IDs are assigned to all new categories.
* **titles.default.fallback** --- the column can be ignored. The same applies to ``slugPrototypes.default.fallback``, ``shortDescriptions.default.fallback``, ``longDescriptions.default.fallback``, ``metaTitles.default.fallback``, ``metaDescriptions.default.fallback``, and ``metaKeywords.default.fallback``.
* **titles.default.value** --- the title of the category. The field is required for new categories.
* **titles.English.fallback** --- the title that the current title should fall back to if no translation is provided in English. Select whether to fall back to **system** (the default value), **parent_localization**, provide your custom value, or leave empty. The same applies to ``slugPrototypes.English.fallback``, ``shortDescriptions.English.fallback``, etc.
* **titles.English.value** --- the English translation of the category title.
* **parentCategory.id** --- the ID of the parent category. If no ID is provided, the parent category title is considered to identify the parent category. If neither ID nor title is provided, it means that the current category does not have any parent category. In this case, all new categories are assigned to the root node of the master catalog, and the parents of all existing categories remain unchanged.
* **parentCategory.title** --- the title of the parent category. The parent title can be provided in two forms, short (Phone Charges) and long (All Products / Electronics / Chargers / Phone Chargers). The long title should start with the root node of the master catalog, separated by `` / `` (space, forward slash, space). It is required to use the long title if you have several categories with the same name to avoid selecting the wrong parent category. If no title is provided, the parent category ID is considered to identify the parent category. If neither ID nor title is provided, it means that the current category does not have any parent category. In this case, all new categories are assigned to the root node of the master catalog, and the parents of all existing categories remain unchanged.
* **Organization** --- the organization that the category is assigned to. You cannot modify the organization for the existing categories. You cannot specify the parent from the organization other than the organization of the child. The column is available if the import is initiated in the global organization (valid for the multi-org Enterprise Edition applications).

.. note:: Check all columns when importing the .csv file. If you do not want to modify the values of a certain field (e.g., ``shortDescriptions``), then you need to delete all columns related to this field, such as ``shortDescriptions.default.value``, ``shortDescriptions.default.fallback``, ``shortDescriptions.English.value``, ``shortDescriptions.English.fallback``. Otherwise, the fields will acquire the empty values after importing overriding the values that may already exist. The only exceptions are the ``parentCategory.id`` and ``parentCategory.title``, as described above.
