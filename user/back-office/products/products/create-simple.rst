To add a new :term:`simple product <Simple Product>` and make it available in the master catalog (for internal product management) and for purchase in the storefront:

1. Navigate to **Products > Products** in the main menu.
2. Click **Create Product**.
3. Select the **Simple** product type.
4. Select the :ref:`product family <products--product-families>` to define the product options and details that will be filled in the following steps.

5. Place the product under the necessary category in the master catalog by clicking on the category. Use the search to limit the list of categories.

6. Click **Continue**.

|
   The product details page appears.

7. In the **General** section:

   a) Enter the product SKU and name.

   b) Enter a URL slug that is used to build a human-readable URL for the product page in the storefront.

   #) Select the product status: *Enabled* or *Disabled*. When disabled, the product is not included in the catalog and is considered to be a draft.

   #) Specify whether the product should be featured or not by selecting *Yes* or *No* respectively.

   #) Specify whether the product is a new arrival. When set to *Yes*, the product is highlighted in the storefront.

   #) For **Brand**, select a :ref:`brand <user-guide--product-brands>` from the list. Use |IcBars| to view the list of all available brands. To create a new brand, click **+**.

   #) Configure units of quantity:

      * In the **Unit Of Quantity** list, select the main :ref:`product unit <user-guide--products--product-units-in-use>` that is shown by default when you view the product details in the storefront. Available options: *each*, *item*, *kilogram*, *piece*, *set*.

      * In the **Precision** field, set the acceptable precision (number of digits after the decimal point) for the quantity that a user may order or add into the shopping list. Items and sets are usually whole numbers, and units like kilograms may get precision of 2 to allow buying a custom volume (e.g., 0.5 kg).

      * Click **+ Add** to add more than one unit of quantity.

        .. image:: /user/img/products/products/ProductsCreate_Units.png
           :alt: The detailed setting of the additional units field

        For every additional unit, provide precision and conversion rate compared to the main unit of quantity.

        Select the **Sell** check box to enable selling the product in these units. Unless **Sell** is selected, the unit is considered to be a draft.

        You can delete the unnecessary unit of quantity by clicking the |IcClose| **Delete** icon next to it.

   #) In the **Tax Code** list, select the :ref:`product tax code <taxes--product-tax-code>` that defines the percentage of tax that may be included into the purchase order during the checkout.

      The tax calculation process depends on the tax jurisdiction that you decided to use in OroCommerce and other tax calculation options.

8. In the **Short Description** section, provide a short but meaningful default description that best positions the product for your target audience and will appear in the catalog listing. Move from tab to tab to localize the description by setting the required fallback option. From the dropdown, you can select whether to fall back to the default value, parent localization, or a custom value. When selecting the custom value, provide the localized version of the short description in the text field.

9. In the **Description** section, provide a long default description of the product that will appear on the product view page. Move from tab to tab to localize the description by setting the required fallback option. From the dropdown, you can select whether to fall back to the default value, parent localization, or a custom value. When selecting the custom value, provide the localized version of the long description in the WYSIWYG field. For more details on WYSIWYG management, see the :ref:`WYSIWYG Editor <getting-started-wysiwyg-editor-field>` topic.

10. In the **Image** section, add a new image to the product by clicking **+Add Image** and then **Choose Image**. You can either upload a new image or select the required one from the list of available :ref:`digital assets <digital-assets>` records.

   Then, select whether to show the image as *main* (the image is used in the product details view), *listing* (the image is shown in the catalog listing), or *additional* (additional product pictures). All three categories can be selected at the same time. To remove the image, click the |IcClose| **Delete** icon next to it.

11. In the **Design** section, select the :ref:`page template <user-guide--page-templates>` from the drop-down.

      :alt: The list of available page templates in the dropdown of the Page Template field

12. In the **SEO** section, provide the following information:

   * **Meta Keywords** --- Enter the meta keywords for the product. A meta keyword is a specific type of a meta tag that appears in the HTML code of a web page and helps tell search engines what the topic of the page is.
   * **Meta Title** --- Enter the meta title for the product. A meta title is what is seen by search engine users and helps a search engine to index the page.
   * **Meta Description** --- Enter the meta description for the product. A meta description summarizes a page content. Search engines show a meta description in search results if they see the searched phrase in the description.
