Inline Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also perform inline editing to amend product details directly from the list.

.. note::

   Inline editing is available for a limited number of fields.

   Point to the field that you want to edit, and if the |IcEditInline| **Edit Inline** icon appears next to a value, it means that inline editing is available for it.

To edit a product inline, double-click the field or the |IcEditInline| **Edit Inline** icon in the field you need to edit and modify the value as required.
