Manage Product Pricing
----------------------

You can add a product price when editing a single product in the Product Prices section of the product details page, as well as centrally manage prices for all products using :ref:`price lists <user-guide--pricing>`.

For more information on pricing, checkout the following topics:

* :ref:`Pricing in OroCommerce <user-guide--pricing>`
* :ref:`Adding Pricing to Individual Products <user-guide--pricing--price-list-manual--product-details>`

When viewing details of a product, you can preview the prices that were assigned to this product manually and using the rule-based price lists.

In the **Product Prices** section, you can filter the prices by price list, quantity (a tier), unit, currency, and the monetary amount.
