Manage Quick Order Form in the Storefront
=========================================

.. begin

The quick order form allows customers to work on large orders in an efficient manner using search by product SKUs and names, or import their purchase lists into the system. Customers can work on multiple orders simultaneously and they can easily switch between different shopping carts or start new orders at any time. Quick order forms can be created by both registered and guest users.

To create an order using a quick order form:

1. Navigate to :ref:`Quick Access Menu <frontstore-guide--navigation-quick-access-menu>` in the top right corner of the page.
2. Click **Quick Order Form**.

   .. note:: Please note that if you are a guest user, you will be able to see only **Quick Order Form** at the top. Only registered customers can view and manage quotes and orders. Also, please keep in mind that only one :ref:`shopping list <frontstore-guide--shopping-lists>` is available for guest customers.

   .. note::

      You can also search the product by name, in which case, you need to select it from the suggestions list when the product appears there.

      Click **Add More Rows** to provide details for more than 5 items.
