Manage Orders in the Storefront
===============================

There are two ways to create an :term:`order <Order>` in the storefront:

* From a shopping list
* From a quick order form

After you submit an order, it becomes available in the :ref:`Order History <my-account-order-history>` menu which you can reach via the Quick Access menu under **Orders**. Here, you can review ordered items, view order billing and shipping information and re-order products from previous orders.
