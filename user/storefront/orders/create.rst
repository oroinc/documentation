You can create an order in two ways:

* From a shopping list
* From a quick order form

Shopping List
-------------

To create an order from a shopping list:

1. Navigate to **Shopping Lists**.
2. From the drop-down list, select the required shopping list.
3. Click **View Details**.
4. To create an order, either click **Create Order** on the right of the shopping list name, or scroll down to the bottom of the page and click **Create Order** on the bottom right of the shopping list view page.

   .. note:: If there are any discounts that apply to your order, this will be displayed in the order totals.
