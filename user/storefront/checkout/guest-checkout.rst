In the Oro storefront, :ref:`guest customers <sys--conf--commerce--guest>` can place orders similarly to registered users. They are, however, limited to just one shopping list.

Unauthenticated customers can proceed to the checkout through:

* Guest Quick Order Forms
* Guest Shopping Lists

At the checkout, guest customers can:

* Login if they have forgotten to do this before placing items in the shopping list.
* Create an account.
