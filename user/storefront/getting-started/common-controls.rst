Manage Common Controls in the Storefront
========================================

.. _frontstore-guide--navigation-tables:

Tables
------

Views in the form of tables can be considered the most commonly used UI elements in Oro applications. They are interactive, as they not only display data about specific store records but contain links to these records’ pages. Views are also configurable – so you can adjust the appearance and contents of the tables to your taste and needs.

Such tables represent aggregated views of data and store records, making it easy to locate and manage records, with every grid page functionally tailored to the type of information it represents.

--------------

**Sorting**

Sorting options are located on the left of the view page under the view table name below the :ref:`filter <frontstore-guide--navigation-filters>`. They allow sorting records alphabetically, by price, relevance, or other attributes related to the products displayed on the page you are viewing.

The following layout options are available:

* Tiles: |IcTiles|

**Page Navigation**

If you have a lot of records, they all may not fit on one data page. In this case, use the pager block in the center above the view table.

In the pager block, you can see the page that you are currently on, the total number of data pages and the total number of records in the view table.

.. image:: /user/img/storefront/navigation/DisplayOptionsPages.png

4. Filters: click |IcFilter| to show/hide filters to select specific items to be shown in the table. More information on filters is provided in the Filters section below.

.. _frontstore-guide--navigation-filters:

Filters
-------

Filters are used when you need to quickly pick out the records you need from the entire data pool.

The following actions are available for filters:

3. To apply a filter, click on its button in the bar and select the required option from the dropdown list.

   .. image:: /user/img/storefront/navigation/FiltersSelect.png

   .. note:: The dropdown list displays all the attributes available for the products on the page you are currently viewing. If there no products related to the searching attributes, the attributes may be hidden from the dropdown list

      .. image:: /user/img/storefront/navigation/FiltersSelectOneAttribute.png

      or remain visible but disabled :ref:`depending on the website configuration <configuration--guide--commerce--configuration--catalog--filters-sorters>` when no items matching selected attributes in filters were found.

   After the filter is applied, its query will appear in the control, so you can easily recall how you have filtered the data.

   .. image:: /user/img/storefront/navigation/FiltersApplied.png

Filter controls may be hidden at all if there are no related products on the displayed page.

   If you wish to reset all applied filters, click **x Clear All Filters**.

.. note:: Filter in the storefront can be displayed either at the top (default) or in the left sidebar.

.. _frontstore-guide--navigation-product-data-export:

Product Data Export
-------------------

   .. image:: /user/img/storefront/navigation/export.png
      :alt: Export product data from the storefront product collection page

.. _frontstore-guide--navigation-product-price:

Your Price and Listed Price
---------------------------

Products in the storefront have two types of price displayed, Your Price and Listed Price.

.. image:: /user/img/products/products/your_listed_pricing_equal.png
     :alt: Your price and listed price are the same in the storefront

Listed Price is the price set for each available product unit and their variation of quantity (tiers). Your Price is Listed price under your current tier pricing configuration.

Suppose we have one product in the default price list with the following price tiers set in the back-office:

* 1 item - $1
* 10 items - $0.80
* 100 items - $0.50
* 1000 items - $0.30

.. image:: /user/img/storefront/navigation/product-tiers-df-pl.png
   :alt: Illustration of price tiers for one product

This means that product price per 1 item will change depending on how many items a buyer wants to purchase. The more they purchase, the cheaper the price per item is going to be in this scenario. The following image illustrates how price tiers are going to be displayed for a user in the storefront.

.. image:: /user/img/storefront/navigation/price-tiers-product-listing.png
   :alt: Illustration of price tiers in the storefront

When a buyer tries to  change the quantity of the items, this triggers change in Your Price.
