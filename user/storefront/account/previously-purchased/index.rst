.. note:: The Previously Purchased section of the storefront can be enabled or disabled by the website administrator depending on the business and website requirements.

From the Previously Purchased section, you can:

* View all your previously purchased products and their price.
* Provide product quantity, add products to :ref:`the shopping list(s) <frontstore-guide--shopping-lists>` and :ref:`create a new shopping list <frontstore-guide--shopping-lists-create>`.
* :ref:`Filter <frontstore-guide--navigation-filters>` products by text, name, SKU, price, and other attributes related to the products displayed on this page.
* Sort them by name, SKU, recency, price, and other product attributes.

By default, previously purchased products are sorted by recency with the newest items displayed first.
