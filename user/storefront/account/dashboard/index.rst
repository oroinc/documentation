Manage Dashboard in the Storefront
==================================

The **Dashboard** menu offers a clear and organized overview of a customer user’s key account activities. Designed for convenience, it helps users stay informed about their orders, quotes, checkouts, and more in a single location. Dashboard eliminates the need to navigate through multiple pages by centralizing essential account information, providing quick access, real-time updates, and intuitive navigation for customer users.

Dashboard consists of multiple sections that offer instant access to important account details. The sections are customized in the :ref:`theme configuration <back-office-theme-configuration>` in the back-office.

* **Quick Access Menu** – A customizable menu with shortcuts to frequently used pages like orders, shopping lists, and RFQs.
* **Latest Orders, Quotes, RFQs, and Checkouts** – A data grid showing recent activities and transactions, allowing customers to quickly review and manage their activity.
* **Purchase Volume Chart** – A visual breakdown of total purchases over the past 12 months, helping users track their spending.
* **Recommended Products** – Personalized product suggestions based on the segments configured in the back-office.
* **Promotional Content** – Important announcements, news, or special offers displayed directly on the dashboard.
