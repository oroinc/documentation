.. _frontstore-guide--profile-consents:

Data Protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. hint:: Read more on this topic in :ref:`Data Protection and Consent Management <user-guide--consents>`.

To comply with the :ref:`data protection regulations (such as CPPA, GDPR, etc.) <user-guide--consents>`, you need to be to provide your explicit consent to the application to process your personal data. All available consents are located in your profile under **Account Info**.

Consents can be mandatory and optional:

* **Mandatory consents** restrict you from proceeding to the checkout or creating RFQs, unless you accept them. Mandatory consents are marked with a red asterisk.
* **Optional consents** do not restrict you from working with the application and are usually used to retrieve permissions to send them email newsletters, inform about upcoming sales or seasonal discounts, etc.

The following key rules apply to consents in OroCommerce:

* **All consents are obtained through explicit actions**

  The checkboxes next to consents are never pre-selected and you can opt in only by explicitly clicking **Accept** under the consent.

* **Consents are informed**

  You can be aware of how exactly your data is going to be processed and shared, and what marketing communications you can expect once you provide your consent. Therefore, you can view all your accepted and pending consents (and their detailed description) in your profile under **Account > My Profile > Account Info** in the storefront.

* **Consents can be revoked**

  If you are no longer happy with a consent, you can revoke it through your profile in the storefront when editing your **Account Info**.
