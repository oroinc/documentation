Manage Quotes in the Storefront
===============================

The Quotes section provides the details on all your created and submitted quotes. Here, you can negotiate with sales representatives on requesting a better price, more convenient quantities and additional services, view, accept, and submit an order based on the offered prices and conditions. In the storefront, this page is nested under the **Quotes** section of the user menu.
