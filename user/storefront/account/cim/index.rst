Manage Payment Profiles (Authorize.Net Customer Profiles) in the Storefront
===========================================================================

When checking out using a credit card or |eCheck|, a customer is presented with the option to store the payment method for future use. This information is stored in your OroCommerce account as an Authorize.Net customer profile. A customer who has a previously saved profile is presented with the option for seamless subsequent checkouts without having to re-enter their payment data. Once you log into your account in the OroCommerce storefront, you can view and manage payment and address information stored within Customer Profiles, as well as add new credit cards and bank accounts.

To locate the information in your customer profile, navigate to **Account > Manage Payment Profiles**.

The Manage Payment Profiles page displays all available payment profiles, both for credit cards and bank accounts.

Payment Profiles on the Authorize.Net Side
------------------------------------------

All credit card and bank account payment profiles are synchronized with Authorize.Net as soon as they are added or modified on the OroCommerce side. You can access all payment details in your Customer Profile on the Authorize.Net side where you can charge or refund a transaction for your profile ID.

.. note:: If you edit or delete a payment profile on the Authorize.Net side, these changes will be reflected in your OroCommerce account. Keep in mind, however, that payment profiles created in Authorize.Net are not synced back to OroCommerce.
