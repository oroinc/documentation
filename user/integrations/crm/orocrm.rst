Security Measures
-----------------

OroCRM includes various security measures to protect sensitive customer data and ensure the platform's overall security. These measures help safeguard against data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security threats. Here are some of the security measures typically implemented in OroCRM:


1. **Authentication and Authorization:**

   * *User authentication:* OroCRM supports strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
   * *Role-based access control (RBAC):* OroCRM allows administrators to define user roles and permissions, ensuring that users have the appropriate level of access to data and functionality based on their roles.

2. **Data Encryption:**

   * *Data in transit:* OroCRM uses secure communication protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring that data is protected during transmission.
   * *Data at rest:* Sensitive data stored in the OroCRM database is often encrypted to prevent unauthorized access in case of a breach.

3. **OAuth2 Protocol for API Access:** OroCRM employs the OAuth2 protocol, which has become the de facto standard for securely accessing data through the API. OAuth2 provides a standardized and secure way for applications and users to access OroCRM's API while maintaining strong authentication and authorization controls. It enables the generation of access tokens and refresh tokens, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with the CRM's API.

4. **Protection Against CSRF Attacks:** OroCRM includes protection mechanisms against CSRF attacks when users change data through the user interface (UI). This protection is achieved by implementing CSRF tokens within forms. These tokens are unique for each user session and must be included with form submissions. When a user submits a form, the server validates the CSRF token to ensure that the request originated from a legitimate and authenticated user session, preventing malicious actions initiated by attackers from other websites.

5. **Data Audit**: OroCRM includes data auditing capabilities to record user activities and system events. This audit trail is useful for monitoring and investigating security incidents.

6. **Account Lockout Mechanism**: OroCRM incorporates an account lockout mechanism designed to thwart brute force attacks. The system monitors login attempts when an attacker repeatedly attempts to gain unauthorized access by guessing a user's password. The user's account is temporarily locked or suspended after a predetermined number of unsuccessful login attempts within a specified timeframe. This proactive approach helps prevent malicious actors from compromising user accounts through brute force attacks.
