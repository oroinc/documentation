Oro Custom Integrations
=======================

Custom integration can be accomplished in a variety of ways, depending on your specific needs. One option is to use Oro API, which provides a powerful and flexible way to integrate your applications. Alternatively, you can use the File Exchange functionality, which can leverage Import/Export to transfer data between systems. Finally, for more complex integration scenarios, you can use the Oro Integration Bundle to build custom integrations that meet your unique requirements.
