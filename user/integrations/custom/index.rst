Oro Custom Integrations
=======================

Application integration is a layer that allows you to migrate your data or enable communication between two systems.

Custom integration can be accomplished in a variety of ways, depending on your specific needs. One option is to use Oro API, which provides a powerful and flexible way to integrate your applications. Alternatively, you can use the File Exchange functionality, which can leverage Import/Export to transfer data between systems. Finally, for more complex integration scenarios, you can use the Oro Integration Bundle to build custom integrations that meet your unique requirements.

The selection of the integration approach relies on the particular needs of the systems being integrated, along with factors including capacity of data, real-time needs, and available technical knowledge.
