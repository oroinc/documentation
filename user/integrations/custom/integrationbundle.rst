IntegrationBundle
=================

|OroIntegrationBundle| introduces a framework that enables developers to create integrations between the OroPlatform-based and third-party applications. It also provides UI for the application users to manage the implemented integrations.

The IntegrationBundle-Based integration approach is a powerful tool for achieving integration with third-party systems. This approach is particularly well-suited for integrating payment and shipping methods, as it ensures that these critical functions are tightly integrated with the rest of your application.

With native application extensions, you can create a seamless user experience by integrating third-party systems directly into your existing application. This approach offers several advantages, including the ability to fully configure and control the integration within the Oro application's user interface. Additionally, real-time interactions and data synchronization can be achieved in many cases, with system events being handled internally and data synchronization initiated immediately upon occurrence.

Another key advantage of extending a native application is that it allows you to leverage existing features and functionalities. This means that you can build on the capabilities of your existing application, rather than starting from scratch. Furthermore, extending a native application can help you benefit from the security features and user access control that are already built into the application.
