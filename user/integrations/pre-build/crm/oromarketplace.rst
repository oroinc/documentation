Security Measures
-----------------

OroMarketplace includes various security measures to protect sensitive customer data and ensure the platform's overall security. These measures help safeguard against data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security threats. Here are some of the security measures typically implemented in OroMarketplace:

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**

   * *User authentication:* OroCRM supports strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
   * *Role-based access control (RBAC):* OroCRM allows administrators to define user roles and permissions, ensuring that users have the appropriate level of access to data and functionality based on their roles.

2. **Data Encryption:**

   * *Data in transit:* OroCRM uses secure communication protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring that data is protected during transmission.
   * *Data at rest:* Sensitive data stored in the OroCRM database is often encrypted to prevent unauthorized access in case of a breach.

3. **OAuth2 Protocol for API Access:** Oro uses the OAuth2 protocol, which is widely accepted as the standard for secure access to data via API. OAuth2 offers a secure and standardized way for applications and users to access Oro's API while maintaining robust authentication and authorization controls. It allows the creation of access tokens and refresh tokens, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with Oro's API.

4. **Protection Against CSRF Attacks:** To guard against potential Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, Oro implements robust security measures aimed at preventing any unauthorized modification of data via the user interface (UI). This is accomplished through the use of unique CSRF tokens, which are integrated into forms for each individual user session. Each form submission must include its corresponding token, and upon receipt, the server verifies the token's legitimacy to ensure that it originates from a genuine and authenticated user session.

5. **Data Audit**: Oro's data auditing capabilities create an audit trail of user activities and system events, which can be monitored and investigated for security incidents.

6. **Account Lockout Mechanism**: Oro uses a mechanism to prevent brute force attacks. The system monitors login attempts and locks or suspends the user's account after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts within a given timeframe. This proactive approach helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access by malicious actors.
