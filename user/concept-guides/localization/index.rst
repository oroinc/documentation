Storefront Localization and Translation
=======================================

In the Oro application, you can provide the translation for all the content elements of your storefront (e.g., product names, descriptions, catalog titles, SEO attributes, and product attribute labels, etc.).

The storefront localization process as well as the back-office one follows the logic described in the :ref:`Localization <sys--config--sysconfig--general-setup--localization>` section.
