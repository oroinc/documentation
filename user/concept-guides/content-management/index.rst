Content Management Concept Guide
================================

OroCommerce offers a smart platform for designing, formatting, adapting, and managing the content on your website. It also allows multiple contributors with corresponding privileges and responsibilities based on their roles to edit, organize, and push the content to live.

With the advanced and user-friendly content management system (CMS), even the people with limited expertise are able to create, work, and deploy their website content. However, customizing the layouts, widgets, or blocks of content may still require some developer assistance.

The content management system is flexible enough to maintain and run various types of websites, such as e-commerce websites, corporate websites, blogs, news websites, and more.

The core default tools integrated into the OroCommerce application and are used to manage the content include:

* :ref:`Web catalog <concept-guide-web-catalog>` --- one of the essential tools that help build unique versions of your website, organize the website menu, and customize the website content for different customers, customer groups, websites, and localizations.
* :ref:`Landing page <concept-guide-landing-page>` --- a CMS page with the intuitive WYSIWYG builder that helps you design high-converting landing pages. The pages would focus website customers' attention on whatever you are promoting, generating new leads, sales, and customers using the inbound marketing techniques, such as SEO, Google AdWords, and website tracking.
* :ref:`Content blocks <concept-guide-content-blocks>` --- blocks of content that help create custom layouts for your website. You can create an unlimited number of content blocks with texts, images, buttons, or widgets using the built-in WYSIWYG editor. Each content block can have its own visibility restrictions and localization settings, which, if configured, are applied to all landing pages where the content block is used. Your website may or may not have content blocks depending on your business requirements.
* :ref:`Content widgets <concept-guide-content-widgets>` --- preconfigured content fragments that you can insert into any landing page or content block with the WYSIWYG field. Out-of-the-box, there are several system content widget types that you can customize to fit your criteria. The creation of additional widgets may require some developer's assistance.
* :ref:`WYSIWYG editor <getting-started-wysiwyg-editor-field>` --- advanced editor for creating and formatting the content. The editor is used with almost all content management tools enabling you to customize the content using different fonts, colors, sizes, alignments, and more. It also lets you view what your page's final result will look like in the storefront while creating the page.
