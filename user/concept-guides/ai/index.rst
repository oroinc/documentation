AI Smart Agent
--------------

The Oro AI Smart Agent is an innovative virtual assistant designed to enhance and simplify the B2B buying experience on OroCommerce. Seamlessly integrated into the OroCommerce Enterprise storefront UI, this AI-powered assistant allows logged-in buyers to engage with the platform using natural spoken or written language, just as they would with a sales representative.

With the Oro AI Smart Agent, buyers can efficiently complete essential e-commerce tasks without requiring extensive training or technical expertise, such as:

* **Order Management** – Create, update, and check order statuses.
* **Product Information** – Find product details, pricing, inventory levels, and compare products.
* **Shopping Lists** – Manage shopping lists, add products, and create orders from them.
* And more.

Once integrated by the Oro team and configured via the :ref:`back-office <admin-configuration-ai-agent-settings>`, any logged-in buyer can access the Oro AI Smart Agent by clicking its icon in the storefront. The agent interface includes three sections:

* **Threads** – Saves previous inquiries for easy reference.
* **Suggestions** – Displays example questions and prompts to guide users.
* **Chat** – Enables real-time interaction through messaging.

Beyond basic inquiries, the AI Smart Agent possesses reasoning capabilities, allowing it to handle complex requests and take actions similar to a sales representative. For instance, users can compare products by asking which is more durable or frequently purchased based on their order history. This functionality reduces operational overhead by minimizing the need for phone calls and emails, enabling buyers to handle their needs directly within the platform.

AI Smart Order
--------------

The AI Smart Order tool modernizes and enhances the purchase order process for distributors and manufacturers, addressing inefficiencies caused by traditional methods like fax or email. In B2B commerce, many buyers still rely on these outdated processes, leading to manual data entry errors and delays. AI Smart Order eliminates these challenges by automating the capture and processing of purchase orders directly within OroCommerce, improving accuracy and operational efficiency.

Using advanced recognition technology, AI Smart Order adapts to any purchase order template or format, accurately capturing key details and validating them against existing system records. This ensures product information, pricing, and inventory levels are correct before processing, minimizing errors and reducing administrative workload. Businesses can save time, lower overhead costs, and focus on scaling operations without the burden of manual order entry.
