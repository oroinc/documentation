Mobile Field Sales App
======================

OroCommerce Field Sales App is a progressive web application (PWA) developed to support sales representatives who operate outside traditional office environments. The app allows users to manage customer interactions, plan and log visits, capture orders, monitor sales activity and key metrics directly from a mobile device. The Field Sales App functions reliably in offline or low-connectivity environments, allowing sales reps to enter order data and update customer records without an internet connection. All data is automatically synchronized once connectivity is restored.

Key Features
------------

Optimized Mobile Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Field Sales App provides a responsive, mobile-first interface designed for efficient use on smartphones and tablets. Sales representatives can quickly access key information such as customer accounts, contact details, product catalogs, and order history. The interface supports fast data entry and navigation, allowing users to create and edit orders or update customer records without delays. The design prioritizes usability in field conditions, minimizing the need for desktop tools.

Offline and Low Connectivity Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Field Sales App is designed to function reliably in areas with limited or no internet access. Sales representatives can continue performing essential tasks such as capturing orders, logging customer visits, and updating records without requiring a network connection. All offline activity is automatically synchronized with the central OroCommerce system once connectivity is restored, maintaining data integrity across the platform. Administrators can configure offline behavior in the app settings. Data availability in offline mode is limited only by the storage capacity of the userâ€™s device.

Order Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Orders menu allows sales representatives to manage all aspects of order creation and tracking directly from a mobile device. They can browse the full product catalog, search for specific product names or SKUs, and add items to new orders, while also being able to view active promotions and best sellers.

Orders can be created and edited in both online and offline modes. When offline, orders are saved as drafts until connectivity is restored. Once back online, all changes are automatically synchronized with the main system, and drafts are submitted accordingly. Previously submitted orders are also accessible and can be modified, with updates synced once the device reconnects.

Centralized View of Customers

Visit Tracking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The app enables users to log and manage customer visits directly from their device. Sales reps can plan upcoming visits, mark visits as started or completed, and track the duration and outcomes of each interaction. This functionality helps monitor sales activities in the field, supports accountability, and provides managers with visibility into visit frequency and execution relative to sales targets or service levels. Reps can also create new orders directly from the Visits page.

A dedicated dashboard presents real-time performance data, including individual and team metrics. Users can track key performance indicators such as order volume, revenue, visit completion rates, and sales goals. This information allows sales representatives and managers to assess performance trends, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions on the go.
