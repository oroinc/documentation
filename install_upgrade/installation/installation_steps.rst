Installation

You can launch the Oro application installation either :ref:`from the console <installation-via-console>`, or using :ref:`the web installation wizard <book-installation-wizard>`.

The installation wizard guides you through the installation process and is more straightforward. However, with console-based installation, you get more flexibility in choosing custom options, like force reinstall. Additionally, from the console, you can install the Oro application in a silent mode.
