OroGridFSConfigBundle
=====================

OroGridFSConfigBundle provides configuration enhancements for Oro applications to enable usage of
|GridFS| as the filesystem for the :ref:`File Storage <backend-file-storage>`.

The bundle enables developers to set MongoDB GridFS parameters in the application configuration YAML files 
which automatically enables and configures GridFS filesystem as storage as |Gaufrette| adapter.
