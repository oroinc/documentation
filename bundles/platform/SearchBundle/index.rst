OroSearchBundle
===============

OroSearchBundle enables the full-text search feature for the Oro applications users and enables the advanced query language usage to build structured queries in the search UI.

The bundle provides the ability for developers to use different search engines, setup configuration for search engines and indexation options for every application entity in the YAML configuration files. It also performs indexation of entire application data, particular entities or even specific entity records using CLI tools.
