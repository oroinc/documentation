OroCheckoutBundle
=================

OroCheckoutBundle enables checkout workflows in the OroCommerce storefront to collect all the necessary information from the customer when they are creating an order. For back-office administrators, this bundle provides the ability to switch between the single page and multi-step page checkout workflows using the system workflow management UI.

The Dependency Injection Tags
-----------------------------

   :header: "Type name","Usage"

   "[oro.checkout.line_item.converter]","The converter provides service to convert a source object to a collection of |CheckoutLineItems| and implements |CheckoutLineItemConverterInterface|."

Checkout Subtotal
-----------------

The data from the Subtotal column (sum of all checkout items) is stored in the database. It is required for efficient assembly of the open orders (checkouts) datagrid. The data gets updated after the following actions:

* Once a product price list is changed, it triggers the subtotal recalculation for all checkouts with such product included.

The list of events:

    * ``Oro\Bundle\PricingBundle\Event\CombinedPriceList\CombinedPriceListsUpdateEvent`` (``oro_pricing.combined_price_list.update``)
    * ``Oro\Bundle\PricingBundle\Event\CustomerGroupCPLUpdateEvent`` (``oro_pricing.customer_group.combined_price_list.update``)
    * ``Oro\Bundle\PricingBundle\Event\CustomerCPLUpdateEvent`` (``oro_pricing.customer.combined_price_list.update``)
    * ``Oro\Bundle\PricingBundle\Event\WebsiteCPLUpdateEvent`` (``oro_pricing.website.combined_price_list.update``)
    * ``Oro\Bundle\PricingBundle\Event\ConfigCPLUpdateEvent`` (``oro_pricing.config.combined_price_list.update``)

* Subtotals are also recalculated within the HTTP-request at each step of the checkout process.

* In the open orders datagrid, subtotals are recalculated once the datagrid information request is received, but only if the related product price list was changed, and subtotal was not updated in the message queue.
