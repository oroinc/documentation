Emails
======

OroCRM allows you to send and receive emails from within the system using both personal and system (company-wide) mailboxes. You can neatly design letters using HTML formatting and a built-in text editor, create and use email templates, attach files to emails, configure personalized signatures.
 
It is also possible to configure auto-actions and auto-responses. For example, with auto-actions, for each email received to a certain mailbox, a lead record or a case may be created in the system.

Oro also provides a feature of auto-assignment to contact, thanks to which new emails synced into the application are automatically linked to contacts, if email addresses of these contacts appeared in the correspondence. 

OroCRM Enterprise Edition also supports integration with Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook.
