Work with Records
======================

With OroCRM, you can record, store, process, and analyze various customer-related data. This information may cover 
different areas, including personal and contact details, records of the customer activity, possible sales and 
arrangements, and many others. This can include any type of information necessary to monitor, manage, and understand 
specific customer-related activities.

In this article, we will review the ways that data is represented and managed in OroCRM. For each point that requires 
further explanation, you will find links to related documentation.
