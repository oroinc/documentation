3. Save the new record or discard it. 
   
   To save the record, click one of the options in the save menu on the top right:
  
   - :guilabel:`Save`—Save the changes and stay on the **Create <Entity name>** page. Use this option if you want to make more changes to the record configuration.   
   
   - :guilabel:`Save and Close`—Save the changes and close the **Create <Entity name>** page. The record view page opens.
   
   - :guilabel:`Save and New`—Save the changes and open a new **Create <Entity name>** page. The blank **Create <Entity name>** page opens. Use this option if you want to immediately create another record. 
   
   To discard the changes, click the :guilabel:`Cancel` button in the upper-right corner of the page.
