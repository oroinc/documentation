Integrations
============

OroCRM is pre-implemented with several third-party systems and may be implemented with many more. The section provides
detailed description of the integrations implemented out-of-the-box in the both OroCRM Community and OroCRM Enterprise
editions (described in more detail in the OroCRM Integrations Overview), as well as description of Embedded Forms that 
can be added to any website to collect requests to the OroCRM team.
