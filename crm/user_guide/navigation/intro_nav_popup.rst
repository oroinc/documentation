Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows
======================================

While using OroCRM, you may sometimes need to inform a user about some events in the system. For example, when an operation has been executed or has failed, or they need to be reminded about a task or event:

* Success flash messages are displayed against the green background:

* If something goes wrong, the flash message is displayed against the red background to attract your attention.

* Other flash messages have a yellow background.

* Sometimes, a flash message contains links to other pages, such as the task reminder above, or this synchronization message:

* Flash messages appear on the top of the screen for several seconds and then disappear. If the user must make a decision before the system can go on, a dialog window appears. The dialog windows have buttons and will not disappear until a decision is made:
