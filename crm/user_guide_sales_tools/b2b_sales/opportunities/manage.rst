Multiple Grid Views

Inline Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Inline editing <doc-grids-actions-records-edit-inline>` can help you amend opportunity details without opening the edit opportunity form. For opportunities, it is available from records' grids and view pages.

If the |IcPencil| **Edit Inline** icon appears next to the field, inline editing is available for that value.

To edit the opportunity from the grid, double-click on the field or the inline editing icon |IcPencil| in the field you wish to edit.
