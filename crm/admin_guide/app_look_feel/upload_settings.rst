Upload Settings
===============

In **System>Configuration>System Configuration>General Setup>Upload Settings**, you can define a set of mime types that will be supported for image and file entities and will be by default supported for attachments in the system.

If :ref:`attachments are enabled for an entity <doc-entity-actions-create>`, the configuration of the entity will prevail and override the corresponding settings configured both globally and per organization.
