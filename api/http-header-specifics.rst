HTTP Header Specifics
=====================

As mentioned in the :ref:`Client Requirements <web-services-api--client-requirements>`
and :ref:`Authentication <web-services-api--authentication>` sections, to perform
an JSON:API request successfully, it is important to provide the correct **Accept**, **Content-Type**
and **Authentication** parameters, e.g.,:

.. code-block:: http


    GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/vnd.api+json
    Authorization: Bearer <access token>

Also, by providing additional requests header parameters, it is possible to retrieve additional information, such as
the total number of records per certain resource for the GET and DELETE methods or a total number of affected records
for the DELETE method. The **X-Include** request header can be used for such purposes.

The following table describes all existing keys for the X-Include header.

+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| HTTP Method | X-Include key   | Response Header           | Description                                          |
+=============+=================+===========================+======================================================+
| any         | noHateoas       |                           | Removes all HATEOAS related links from the response. |
+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| GET         | totalCount      | X-Include-Total-Count     | Returns the total number of entities.                |
+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| DELETE      | totalCount      | X-Include-Total-Count     | Returns the total number of entities.                |
+-------------+-----------------+---------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| DELETE      | deletedCount    | X-Include-Deleted-Count   | Returns the number of deleted entities.              |
