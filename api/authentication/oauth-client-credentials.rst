Client Credentials Grant Type: Generate Token
=============================================

To configure the authentication via the client credentials grant type and retrieve the access token:

1. Provide your **Request URL**.

   The Request URL consists of your application URL and the /oauth2-token slug, e.g., ``https://yourapplication/oauth2-token``

2. Specify the content-type in headers:

   `Content-Type: application/json`

3. Send a POST request with the following body parameters to the authorization server:

   * `grant_type` with the value ``client_credentials``
   * `client_id` with the client’s ID
   * `client_secret` with the client’s secret ID

4. Receive response from the authorization server with a JSON object containing the following properties:

   * `token_type` with the value ``Bearer``
   * `expires_in` = 3600 seconds. Once the token is generated, it is valid for an hour and can be used multiple times within this time limit to request the necessary data. Expiration time can by configured in :ref:`config/config.yml <bundle-docs-platform-oauth2-server-bundle--configuration>` of your application.
   * `access_token` a JSON web token signed with the authorization server’s private key

5. Use the generated access token to make requests to the API.

**Example**

Request

.. code-block:: http


    POST /oauth2-token HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json

Request Body

.. code-block:: json


    {
        "grant_type": "client_credentials",
        "client_id": "your client identifier",
        "client_secret": "your client secret"
    }

Response Body

.. code-block:: json


    {
        "token_type": "Bearer",
        "expires_in": 3600,
        "access_token": "your access token"
    }

The received access token can be used multiple times until it expires. A new token should be requested once
the previous token expires.

An example of an API request:

.. code-block:: http


    GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/vnd.api+json
    Authorization: Bearer your access token

.. note:: Access tokens for back-office and storefront API are not interchangeable. If you attempt to request data for the storefront API with a token generated for the back-office application, access will be denied.
