Web Services API Guide
======================

REST API enables developers to integrate Oro functionality into third-party software systems.

An application programming interface (API) is a software interface which is designed to be used by other software for integration with this application.
Whilst an ordinary software program is used by a (human) computer user, an API is a software program used by
another software program.

The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style is an abstraction of the architectural elements
within a distributed hypermedia system. REST ignores the details of component implementation and protocol syntax in
order to focus on the roles of the components, the constraints on their interaction with other components, and their
interpretation of significant data elements. It encompasses the fundamental constraints on components, connectors,
and data that define the basis of the Web architecture, and thus the essence of its behavior as a network-based
application.

|JSON:API| is a specification for how a client should request those resources to
be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to them. It is designed to minimize both the number of requests
and the amount of data transmitted between the clients and the servers. This efficiency is achieved without compromising
on readability, flexibility or discoverability.

Therefore, here and below the term *API* will refer to the REST API that conforms the JSON:API specification that gives
programmatic access to read and write data. Request and response body should use JSON format.
