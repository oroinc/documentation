Available HTTP Methods
======================

The primary or most commonly-used HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively. There are a number of other methods, too, but they are utilized less frequently.

Below is a table summarizing HTTP methods available in Oro API and their return values in combination with the resource URIs:


+-------------+----------------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| HTTP Method | CRUD operation | Entire Collection (e.g. /users)                | Specific Item (e.g. /users/{id})             |
+=============+================+================================================+==============================================+
| GET         | Read           | 200 (OK), list of entities.                    | 200 (OK), single entity.                     |
|             |                | Use pagination, sorting and filtering          |                                              |
|             |                | to navigate big lists.                         | 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid. |
|             |                |                                                |                                              |
+-------------+----------------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

| DELETE      | Delete         | 204 (No Content).                              | 204 (No Content).                            |
|             |                |                                                |                                              |
|             |                | 400(Bad Request) if no filter is specified.    | 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid. |
+-------------+----------------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| PUT         | Update/Replace | **not implemented**                            | **not implemented**                          |

Also, the HTTP methods can be classified by the *idempotent* and *safe* properties.

The *safe* methods are the HTTP methods that do not modify resources. For instance, using GET or HEAD on a resource URL,
should NEVER change the resource.

An *idempotent* HTTP method is an HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes. It would not
matter if the method is called only once, or ten times over. The result should be the same.
For more details, please see |RFC 7231: Common Method Properties|.

Below is a table summarizing HTTP methods by its idempotency and safety:


+-------------+------------+------+
| HTTP Method | Idempotent | Safe |
+=============+============+======+
| OPTIONS     | yes        | yes  |
+-------------+------------+------+
| GET         | yes        | yes  |
+-------------+------------+------+
| HEAD        | yes        | yes  |
+-------------+------------+------+
| PUT         | yes        | no   |
+-------------+------------+------+
| POST        | no         | no   |
+-------------+------------+------+
| DELETE      | yes        | no   |
+-------------+------------+------+
| PATCH       | no         | no   |

.. _web-services-api--http-methods--get:

GET
---

The HTTP GET method is used to *read* (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In case of success (or non-error), GET returns a representation in JSON and an HTTP response status code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST).

.. note::
    According to the design of the HTTP specification, GET requests are used only to read data and not change it.
    So, they are considered safe. That is they can be called without risk of data modification or corruptionâ€”calling it once has the same effect as calling it 10 times.


.. _web-services-api--http-methods--post:

POST
----

The POST method is most often utilized to *create* new resources. In particular, it is used to create subordinate
resources. That is subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource,
POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an
ID (new resource URI), etc.

On successful creation, HTTP response code 201 is returned.

.. caution::

    POST is not a safe operation. Making two identical POST requests will most likely result in two resources containing the same information but with different identifiers.

.. note::
    It is possible to create both primary and related API resources via a single API request. For details, see the
    :ref:`Creating and Updating Related Resources with Primary API Resource <web-services-api--create-update-related-resources>` section.


.. _web-services-api--http-methods--patch:

PATCH
-----

PATCH is used to *modify* resources. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource,
not the complete resource.

In other words, the body should contain a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the
server should be modified to produce a new version.

.. caution::

    PATCH is not a safe operation. Collisions from multiple PATCH requests may be dangerous because some patch formats need to operate from a known base point; otherwise, they will corrupt the resource. Clients using this kind of patch
    application should use a conditional request (e.g., GET a resource, ensure it was not modified and apply PATCH) such that the request will fail if the resource has been updated since the client last accessed the resource.

.. note::
    For details, see the :ref:`Creating and Updating Related Resources with Primary API Resource <web-services-api--create-update-related-resources>` section.


.. _web-services-api--http-methods--delete:

DELETE
------

DELETE is quite easy to understand. It is used to *delete* a resource identified by filters or ID.

On successful deletion, the HTTP response status code 204 (No Content) returns with no response body.

.. important::

    If you DELETE a resource, it is removed. Repeatedly calling DELETE on that resource will often return a 404 (NOT FOUND) status code since it was already removed and, therefore, is no longer findable.
