All API access is over HTTP or HTTPS (depending on a server configuration) and is accessed from the ``http(s)://<hostname_of_your_oro_application>/api/<resource_name>``
All data is sent and received as JSON.

A typical request can be performed via curl or JSON sandbox.

**Curl Example**

.. code-block:: http


    GET /api/users/1 HTTP/1.1

    curl -X "GET" -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json"
         -H "Authorization: Bearer ..."
    http://localhost.com/api/users/1
