Customers
=========

**Customers** represent companies who buy products using the storefront. **Customer users** are actual people who act on behalf of companies (i.e. customers) and have a limited set of permissions which depend on their role and function in the customer organization. You can manage customer users and roles in the back-office, or you can delegate this function to the customer who will access user and role management in the storefront.

In the Customer section, you can manage the customers who represent a group of buyers related to the same business organization.

Navigate to **Customers > Customers** in the main menu.

Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary customer to perform the following actions:

* |IcView| **View** customer details. Alternatively, click on the item to open its details page.
* |IcEdit| **Edit** customer details.
* |IcDelete| **Delete** existing customers.

On the customer details page, you get access to the aggregated information about customer users activities and eCommerce operations, such as requests for quotes, quotes, sales orders, and shopping lists.
