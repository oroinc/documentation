2. Choose the product that you need to modify, click the |IcMore| **More Options** menu at the end of the row, and then click the |IcEdit| **Edit** icon.
#. Change the product settings as required. For the description of the fields, see :ref:`Create a Product <doc--products--actions--create>` action description.

Inline Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also perform inline editing to amend product details directly from the list.

.. note::

   Inline editing is available for a limited number of fields.

   Point to the field that you want to edit, and if the |IcEditInline| **Edit Inline** icon appears next to a value, it means that inline editing is available for it.

To edit a product inline, double-click the field or the |IcEditInline| **Edit Inline** icon in the field you need to edit, and modify the value as required.
