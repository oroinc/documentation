Grid Views

Inline Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inline editing within the grid can help you amend lead details without opening the edit lead form. To edit leads from the grid, double-click on the field or the edit icon in the field you wish to edit.

Lead View
---------

The lead page contains all available information on the lead in the **General Information** section and the **Activity** section shows all activity for a lead that has taken place, such as phone calls placed or emails sent to the lead.
