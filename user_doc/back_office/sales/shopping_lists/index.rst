Shopping Lists 
==============

Shopping lists are similar to shopping carts in most online stores. However, shopping lists have additional features. These include the ability to:

* Manage multiple shopping lists simultaneously.
* Request quotes from a shopping list.
* Submit orders from a shopping list.
* Create as many shopping lists as needed.

Via the back-office, you can access any shopping list created in the Oro storefront.

Information on shopping lists is covered in the following sections:

Overview
--------

In the Shopping Lists section in back-office, a salesperson can view all shopping lists created and saved by the customers in the OroCommerce storefront.

On behalf of the customer, a salesperson can manage the items in the shopping list: edit, add, remove, change quantity, units, and add notes.
