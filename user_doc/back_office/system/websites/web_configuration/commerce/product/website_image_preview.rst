2. For the necessary website, hover over the |IcMore| more actions menu to the right of the necessary website and click |IcConfig| to start editing the configuration.
3. Select **Commerce > Product > Product Images** in the menu to the left.

   .. note:: For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

5. In the **Image Gallery Options** section, the following options are available:

   * **Enable Image Preview on Product Listing** --- When this option is enabled, clicking on the product image on the product listing page in the storefront will open a pop up image gallery, rather than the product page.

     .. image:: /user_doc/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImagePreviewEnabledWebsite.png
        :class: with-border

     When the option is disabled, clicking on the product image on the product listing page in the storefront will open the product page.

     .. image:: /user_doc/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImagePreviewDisabledWebsite.png
        :class: with-border

6. When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is enabled, image gallery in the storefront takes the following form:

   .. image:: /user_doc/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImageGalleryWebsiteEnabled1.png
      :class: with-border

   By clicking on the image, the pop up gallery is displayed in the middle of the screen:

   .. image:: /user_doc/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImageGalleryWebsiteEnabled2.png
      :class: with-border

5. When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is disabled, the image gallery takes the form of an inline view:

   .. image::/img/system/websites/web_configuration/ImageGalleryWebsiteDisabled.png
      :class: with-border

   Flick through the pictures in the gallery by pressing < or > arrows without leaving the product page.

   .. note:: If the **Use System** check box is selected, system configuration is applied.
