Contact Groups 
==============

A **contact group** is a system entity that represents a group of :term:`contacts <Contact>`.
By default, contact groups are used in :ref:`filters and segments <user-guide-filters-management>`.


Create a Contact Group
----------------------

In order to create a contact group:

1. In the main menu, navigate **System > Contact Groups**.
2. Click **Create Contact Group**.
3. Define the general details and the list of contacts for the group:

   * **Owner** --- Limits the list of users that can manage the contact group to the users whose :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` allow managing contact groups of the owner (e.g., the owner, members of the same business unit, system administrator, etc.).
   * **Label** --- The name used to refer to the contact group on the interface.
  
4. Select / clear the **HAS GROUP**  check box, to assign / unassign a contact to the contact group.

.. note::
    The **HAS GROUP** check box defines if the contact is assigned a specific contact group that you are creating / editing.

5. Click **Save and Close**.

Now, you can |IcEdit| edit or |IcDelete| delete a contact group from the system by clicking the corresponding icon next to the required row in the grid.
