View Records
------------

.. start_view

To view more details of a specific record and to work directly with the record (i.e., create a task related to a
customer, appoint a calendar event for a user, turn a cart into an order, share a contact, and so on), you need to get
to its details page (as in the example).

Here, you can see all the details of the record and its location on the map. You can use the links and
action buttons as described in this article. Information on a view page of the selected record is allocated in sections that you can easily switch between. All the sections are placed one after another, so you can also scroll down to find the required information.

You can do the following actions on the details page:

* :ref:`Edit the record <doc-grids-actions-records-edit>`
* :ref:`Delete the record <doc-grids-actions-records-delete>`
* :ref:`Share the record <doc-grids-records-share>`
* Add :ref:`attachments <user-guide-activities-attachments>`, :ref:`notes <user-guide-add-note>`, and :ref:`comments <user-guide-activities-comments>` to the record
* :ref:`Export <export-records>` and :ref:`import <import-records>` the record details
