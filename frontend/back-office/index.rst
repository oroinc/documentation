Back-Office Customization
=========================

**OroCommerce back-office, OroCRM, and OroPlatform** are single-page applications (SPA) with a mix of server-rendered content with Twig templating engine and client rendered content with Underscore.js. You can customize it with themes, override SCSS Styles, Twig, and Underscore.js templates and extend parts of a page with placeholders.
