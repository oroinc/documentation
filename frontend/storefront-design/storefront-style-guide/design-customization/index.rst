Design Customization
--------------------

Each brand has its own corporate identity, which allows you to stand out in the market and create an impression of yourself.

Begin customization of the OroCommerce Storefront theme interface to align it with your corporate identity.

We have compiled a :ref:`Storefront Style Guide <storefront-style-guide--quick-start>` to facilitate the development of the OroCommerce theme design. This section of the documentation contains instructions on how to quickly and easily change the Storefront theme style.

Storefront Style Guide Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a sketch file and navigate to the **Layers** panel on the left:

* **Elements & Controls** - contains artboards with interface elements, color palette, and typography settings
* **Symbols** - contains a list of *symbols* used in the interface
* **Pages** - contains a list of all pages of the OroCommerce Storefront in the following resolutions: 375px, 768px, 1440px
