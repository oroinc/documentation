Typography
^^^^^^^^^^

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable and appealing when displayed. In the context of interfaces, the text is one of the main ways of communicating with the user.

Continue updating the theme by changing typography styles. On the **Elements & Controls** page, in the **Typography Settings** artboard, update the styles of text elements (headings, links, lists, etc.) to match your corporate identity.

To see the applied result, navigate to any page in the **Pages** section.


.. hint:: To apply the changes successfully, you need to update the styles on the artboard. To do this, select the element for which the style has been changed, and in the **Appearance** section of the sidebar, click **Update**.
