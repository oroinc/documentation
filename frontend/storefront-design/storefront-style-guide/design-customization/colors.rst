Colors
^^^^^^

The OroCommerce Storefront theme contains its own color palette connected to the interface elements:

* *Primary* and *Secondary* colors are defined to represent your brand.
* *Additional* colors complement the interface with shades.
* *UI* colors refer to the system elements, like messages, validations, etc.

Colors are saved in Sketch as *styles* with the name of storefront color variables.


Logo Replacement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, the company logo contains the primary corporate colors of the brand. For the convenience of using the color palette, replace the OroCommerce logo with yours:

* On the **Elements & Controls** page, in the **Color Settings** artboard, select the logo by clicking on it
* Press **Enter** to open its symbol.
* Replace the logo with the one you need and return to the artboard

Once the logo is replaced on all pages, use the eyedropper tool (Control + C) to change the colors of the palette based on your logo requirements.


Change Palette Colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the **Elements & Controls** page, in the **Color Settings** artboard:

* Select the layer of the desired color
* In the **Fills** section, change the fill color to the desired one
* In the **Appearance** section, click **Update**

Once the color is applied to the existing style, all elements using this style are changed automatically, i.e., they will change their color. To view the result, open the pages in the **Pages** section.

.. hint:: We do not recommend renaming the styles of the color palette as they are consistent with the color palette of the OroCommerce Storefront theme. Use this structure to create your own unique design.
