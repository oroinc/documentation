Principles
----------

The Atomic Design approach is used in the structure of the user interface, which means that all functional elements consist of:

* :ref:`Atoms <principles-atoms>` - the smallest elements that cannot be separated and that serve as elementary blocks of the interface (colors, typography, buttons, icons, etc.)
* :ref:`Molecules <principles-molecules>` - groups of atoms that form relatively simple functional interface elements (pop-up, button with dropdown, navigation menu)
* :ref:`Organisms <principles-organisms>` - groups of molecules that form the relatively complex parts of the interface (header, footer, sidebar)
* :ref:`Templates <principles-templates>` - help place components in the layout and demonstrate the content structure underlying the design
* :ref:`Pages <principles-pages>` - help apply real content to templates displaying the final interface
