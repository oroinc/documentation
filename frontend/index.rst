Frontend Developer Guide
========================

This documentation provides instruction on how to customize OroPlatform-based applications look and feel with themes.

There are two types of themes:

 - :ref:`Storefront themes <dev-doc-frontend-storefront>` used for OroCommerce storefront
 - :ref:`Back-Office themes <dev-doc-frontend-back-office-theming>` used for OroCommerce back-office, OroPlatform, and OroCRM

.. hint:: Back-office themes cannot be used in the storefront and vice-versa.

:ref:`Storefront Design <frontend--storefront-design>` guides you on how to create and customize OroPlatform-based application UI using Sketch.

All the themes use the same :ref:`Javascript Architecture <dev-doc-frontend-javascript>` except for the way the JS modules are registered.
