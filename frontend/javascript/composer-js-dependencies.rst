Managing NPM dependencies with Composer
=======================================

Oro application code (including PHP code, Javascript code, SCSS, etc.) is distributed via Composer packages.
In the previous versions, we also used Composer to manage all external dependencies - both PHP and frontend.
The PHP package dependencies were managed by Composer natively, and the frontend dependencies (NPM and Bower packages) -
via a Composer “proxy gateway” (asset-packagist) to NPM and Bower registries.

As NPM allows a lot more freedom in package naming, we could no longer update some of our NPM dependencies because Composer does not recognize or does not allow some NPM package names (e.g., with a different letter case or special characters). That is why we had to switch from  using asset packagist to calling NPM directly from the composer install and composer update scripts.

Minimum Requirements
--------------------

The following software is required for `composer` to install JS dependencies:

 - |Node.js|, version 18
 - |NPM|

.. hint:: For instructions on how to install **Node.js**, navigate to the |Node.js official website|.

General Information
-------------------

|NPM| packages represent JS dependencies of the application. NPM packages are recursively collected from `composer.json` files of all application dependencies. During `composer install` (either `update` or `require`) they are passed to NPM utility, which handles further installation.

.. hint:: For more information on NPM, see |NPM documentation|.

Workflow
--------

Initial Install of Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the `composer install` command composer runs the ``Oro\Bundle\InstallerBundle\Composer\ScriptHandler::installAssets`` post-install command, which recursively collects NPM packages from `composer.json` files of all application dependencies. Collected NPM packages are passed to `npm install` which handles further installation:

* updates `dependencies` section in existing `package.json` or creates new file
* generates `package-lock.json` file
* fetches NPM packages and puts them into `node_modules/` directory

.. hint:: The generated `package.json` file is a technical file which should not be changed manually and is ignored by Git.

An example of `composer.json` containing NPM dependencies in the `extra.npm` section:

.. code-block:: json

	{
		"name": "oro/calendar-bundle",

		"_comment": "skipped part of file",

		"extra": {
			"npm": {
				"fullcalendar": "3.4.0"
			},
		}
	}

Application Install When Lock Files Already Exist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If `package-lock.json` already exists, post-install command ``Oro\Bundle\InstallerBundle\Composer\ScriptHandler::installAssets`` runs `npm ci` which looks into the lock file, fetches NPM packages, and puts them into the `node_modules/` directory.

Adding New NPM Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add the NPM package name and version constraint to the `extra.npm` section of composer.json, e.g `"fullcalendar": "3.4.0"`.
- Delete `composer.lock` and the `package-lock.json` files.
- Run `composer install`.

Resolving Conflicting NPM Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible that you can have two different versions of the same NPM package defined in two separate Composer packages.
To resolve this conflict, define the version that you want to use in the root `composer.json` file of your application.
