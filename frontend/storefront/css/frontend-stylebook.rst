Oro Frontend Stylebook
======================

|Oro StyleBook| is a UI elements and components library that helps developers and designers use the recommended templates to build or customize the Oro application pages. The information in the UI library may be used in two different ways.

 * When you modify your Oro application layout, you can copy the element`s source code to your custom form or page in the Oro application to preserve the overall look and feel consistency.

 * After you have modified your Oro application styles or layout, you can use the |StyleBook| to check how updated styles affect the UI elements (see :ref:`Oro Styles Architecture <dev-doc-frontend-css>`, :ref:`Styles Organization <dev-doc-frontend-css-frontend-styles-assets>`, and :ref:`Customization <storefront_customization_guide>` for more information on the UI customization).

Most of the OroCommerce back-office and storefront UI elements are included and grouped into the following categories:

General Look and Feel
