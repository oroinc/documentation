Storefront Customization
========================

This documentation provides instruction on how to customize OroCommerce storefront looks and feel with themes. Developing and customizing the OroCommerce back-office design is out of the scope of this guide and covered by :ref:`the Back-Office Design Customization Guide<dev-doc-frontend-back-office-theming>`.

The OroCommerce storefront design architecture has some differences from the back-office:
   - It is not using the SPA approach for the SEO optimization, but the Javascript Framework is the same;
   - Themes are built on top of the OroLayouts framework which is much more flexible than the placeholders approach used for back-office themes;
   - You can also customize it with themes, but as the architecture is different, you cannot reuse the same theme for OroCommerce storefront and back-office.
