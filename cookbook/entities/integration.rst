How to Create an Integration
============================

Sometimes you need to integrate data from external systems into your application. For example,
imagine that you have another application where tasks can be created that you want to sync with
OroCRM. OroPlatform provides means to achieve a seamless integration of other applications through
the `OroIntegrationBundle`_.

Basic Implementation and Configuration
--------------------------------------

Integrating other applications requires to implement some services that form the integration
skeleton:

* :ref:`Create a new Channel <cookbook-integration-channel>`
* :ref:`Read the Data Using a Transport <cookbook-integration-transport>`
* :ref:`Connect the Data to Your Entities <cookbook-integration-connector>`

.. _cookbook-integration-channel:

Create a new Channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to define a new channel. A channel is the way to make your integration visible in
the integration section of the admin interface. A channel is a class that has to implement the
:class:`Oro\\Bundle\\IntegrationBundle\\Provider\\ChannelInterface`:

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    namespace AppBundle\Integration;

    use Oro\Bundle\IntegrationBundle\Provider\ChannelInterface;

    class TaskChannel implements ChannelInterface
    {
        public function getLabel()
        {
            return 'app.task_channel.label';
        }
    }

The ``ChannelInterface`` requires you to interface the ``getLabel()`` method which is a translation key
that will be shown to the user in the UI after being translated.

Additionally, you can implement the :class:`Oro\\Bundle\\IntegrationBundle\\Provider\\IconAwareIntegrationInterface`
if you also like to display an icon. You then also need to implement the ``getIcon()`` method which
returns a path to the icon relative to the project's web directory:

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

        // src/AppBundle/Integration/TaskChannel.php
        namespace AppBundle\Integration;

        // ...
        use Oro\Bundle\IntegrationBundle\Provider\IconAwareIntegrationInterface;

        class TaskChannel implements ChannelInterface, IconAwareIntegrationInterface
        {
            // ...

            public function getIcon()
            {
                return 'icons/task.png';
            }
        }

After having created the class you need to make it available in the user interface by registering
it as a service and tag it with the ``oro_integration.channel`` tag and configure the ``type``
attribute which must be a unique value that is used internally by the OroIntegrationBundle to refer
to the channel:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    // src/AppBundle/Resources/config/integration.yml
    services:
        class: AppBundle\Integration\TaskChannel
        tags:
            - { name: oro_integration.channel, type: app_channel }

.. _cookbook-integration-transport:

Read the Data Using a Transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For every channel you can define several ways to read the data from your external application (for
example, either via SOAP or a HTTP REST API). This concept is called a transport. A class providing
such a transport must implement the :class:`Oro\\Bundle\\IntegrationBundle\\Provider\\TransportInterface`.
This interface requires four methods to be implemented:

``init(Transport $transport)``
    Initializes the transport. The passed object contains the settings for this transport that was
    configured using the form type identified by the name returned by ``getSettingsFormType()``. It
    is an instance of the class configured by the ``getSettingsEntityFQCN()`` method.

``getLabel()``
    The translation key used to display the transport label in the UI.

``getSettingsFormType()``
    The name (as returned by ``FormInterface::getName()``) of the form type that is used to let the
    user configure transport specific settings (for example, access credentials for API endpoints).

``getSettingsEntityFQCN()``
    The fully-qualified class name of the entity that stores the settings configured through the
    aforementioned form type (this should be a subclass of :class:`Oro\\Bundle\\IntegrationBundle\\Entity\\Transport`).

Then, register your transport as a service and tag it with the ``oro_integration.transport`` tag.
Use the ``channel_type`` attribute to define the channel the transport is connected with. You need
to give the transport an identifier using the ``type`` attribute that must be unique across the
channel:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

        // src/AppBundle/Resources/config/integration.yml
        services:
            class: AppBundle\Integration\RestTransport
            tags:
                - { name: oro_integration.transport, channel_type: app_channel, type: rest }

.. _cookbook-integration-connector:

Connect the Data to Your Entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your final step is to implement the :class:`Oro\\Bundle\\IntegrationBundle\\Provider\\ConnectorInterface`:

``getLabel()``
    The translation key used to display the connector label in the UI.

``getImportExportEntityFQCN()``
    The fully-qualified class name of the entities being imported.

``getImportJobName()``
    The job name that handles the import.

``getType()``
    A string that identifies the connector. This must be unique throughout the channel.

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    // src/AppBundle/Integration/TaskConnector.php
    namespace AppBundle\Integration;

    use Oro\Bundle\IntegrationBundle\Provider\ConnectorInterface;

    class TaskConnector implements ConnectorInterface
    {
        public function getLabel()
        {
            return 'app.connector.task.label';
        }

        public function getImportExportEntityFQCN()
        {
            return 'AppBundle\Entity\Task';
        }

        public function getImportJobName()
        {
            return 'app_task_import';
        }

        public function getType()
        {
            return 'task';
        }
    }

The class implementing the ``ConnectorInterface`` must then be registered as a service tagged with
``oro_integration.connector``. Use the ``channel_type`` attribute to define the channel that the
connector is associated with. The ``type`` attribute must get the same value that is returned by
the connector's ``getType()`` method:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

            // src/AppBundle/Resources/config/integration.yml
            services:
                class: AppBundle\Integration\TaskConnector
                tags:
                    - { name: oro_integration.connector, channel_type: app_channel, type: task }
