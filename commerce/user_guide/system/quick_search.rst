Quick Search Usage
==================

Quick Search enables you to find the particular item you are looking for in a fast and simple way by performing a smart search with a minimum typing.

The **Quick Search** function narrows down your query and provides a quick navigation between the menu items by specifying keywords, phrases, or field values.

You can search for configuration options in the management console on any level:

1. Globally --- Navigate to **System > Configuration** in the main menu.

2. Per organization --- Navigate to **System > User Management > Organizations** in the main menu. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary organization and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

3. Per website --- Navigate to **System > Websites** in the main menu. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary website and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

4. Per user --- Navigate to **System > User Management > Users** in the main menu. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the necessary user and click |IcConfig| to reach the configuration page.

As an example, let us find the **Language Settings** menu via the **Quick Search** field. The menu resides under **System Configuration > General Setup** in the left panel.

To find the menu, proceed with the following steps:

1. Start typing *language* in the **Quick Search** field.

2. Only the items with the *language* in their titles will be displayed and highlighted upon your request.
