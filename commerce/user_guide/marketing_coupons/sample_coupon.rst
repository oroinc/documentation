Sample Coupon Generation
------------------------

.. begin

As an illustration, let us create a sample promotion and generate 100 coupons for it. These coupons will be redeemed for orders placed by first-time customers. The promotion will offer 50% discount for all orders between 18 and 22 September 2017.

Create a Promotion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As coupons should always be linked to promotions, the first step is to create a new promotion:

1. Navigate to **Marketing > Promotions > Promotions** in the main menu.
2. Click **Coupons Actions > Create Promotion** on the top right.
