As a promotional tool, coupons can be generated and distributed to customers to be redeemed for a discount when purchasing goods online. In your Oro application, coupons are always linked to promotions, although they can be created separately and linked to a promotion when the need arises.

The following topics will explore how to create, generate and manage coupons in your Oro application.
