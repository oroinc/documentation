2. Click |Bdropdown| next to **Sub-Categories** to select the required option from the list.

   The available options are:

   * **Include, show as filter** - Used to include all the products assigned to the subcategories of the selected category in addition to the products that are already assigned directly. The subcategories of the first level with at least one product will be displayed as a category filter in the OroCommerce Store Front.

   * **Do not include** - Used to include the products assigned only to the selected category. In case the category has a subcategory, its product items will not be displayed.

4. This step applies only to the content nodes with more than one content variant.

   When your category is not selected as a default variant for the content node, there is a *Restrictions* section beneath the tree of categories. In this section, you can define the condition when the selected category overrides the default content variant. See :ref:`Configure Content Visibility <user-guide--marketing--web-catalog--content--visibility>` section for more information.

5. Click **Save** when you are done filling in the web catalog content node or keep adding the content variants.
