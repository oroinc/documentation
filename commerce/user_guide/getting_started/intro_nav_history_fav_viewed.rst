History
-------

This section displays links to the 20 latest pages you’ve visited in reverse chronological order. This list is particularly useful when you want to open a page that you have recently used without searching for it.

Favorites
---------

The links to all the pages that you have marked as "favorite" are displayed in this section.

Add a Page to the "Favorites" List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the pages can be marked as a "favorite". This is handy when you need to return to the same page repeatedly. 
In order to do so, click the star-shaped *"Mark as favorite*" icon in the top right corner of the page.

The icon will turn yellow and a link to the page will appear in the *"Favorites*" menu.

The icon will turn grey and the page will be removed from the *"Favorites*" list.
