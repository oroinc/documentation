The Menu Bar
------------

The menu bar is the main mode of accessing data in OroCRM, and is always displayed on every page. Subject to your 
organization configuration, it may be displayed horizontally or vertically. In the latter case, the menu items will be 
displayed as icons.

Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows
--------------------------------------

Flash notifications and dialog windows are used by OroCRM to notify you about something important.

If just a notification is needed (e.g., to mark the success or failure of an operation, a reminder, etc.), the flash 
message will appear. They may contain links to more detailed information.

If your decision is required, and OroCRM cannot proceed without it, a dialog window will appear and will remain in place 
until you click a button. They usually pop up in order to warn you about something very important or irreversible, such 
as deleting records.

To see examples of flash messages and dialog windows, please read the
:ref:`Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows <user-guide-intro-popups>` guide.
