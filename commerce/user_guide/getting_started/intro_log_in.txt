    The **login using google** option may not be available for your organization, check with your OroCommerce Administrator.

Your administrator will determine this but typically upon your user account creation you will receive an email with your login credentials. In order to log in to the system for the first time, type in the username and password specified in the email. In order to save your credentials on a device, check the **Remember me on this computer** box before you log in.

.. caution::

    It is strictly recommended to change your password immediately after the first login. You can learn how to do it in the :ref:`Changing Your Password section <user-guide-getting-started-profile-password>` below.

If you have forgotten the credentials, click the **Forgot your password?** link and follow the wizard to restore them.

Log in Using Your Google Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the Google Single Sign-On capability has been enabled for your organization, you will see the **login using google** link at the login screen. This means you can log in using your corporate Gmail account credentials. Usually this capability is enabled for corporate email addresses only, so your personal mailbox credentials won’t do.

Log in Using Other Corporate Credentials 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OroCommerce can be set up to accept your existing corporate login and password. This is possible if your organization utilizes a common server to share them across multiple applications. This is referred to as LDAP integration. Please check with your system administrator to see if this is the case.
