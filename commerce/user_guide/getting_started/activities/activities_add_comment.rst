Comments
========

Interaction between users is an important part of successful work. In order to enable users to leave comments on records
of an :term:`entity <Entity>` or on details of an :ref:`activity <user-guide-activities>`, other than a contact request 
(e.g. leave some additional details of task, comment on an email sent or a call made, etc.) use the **Add Comment**
action.

.. important::
    By default, the list of activities available for each entity is determined by what is most commonly used by businesses. However, if your company's work process requires it, you can always turn the desirable activity on for almost any entity (except technical ones). If you need particular activities to be enabled for an entity, contact your administrator, or see steps 4 and 5 of the :ref:`Create an Entity <doc-entity-actions-create>` action description


Create and View Comments
------------------------

Once a record or an activity have been created, a comment can be added to it from:

- Record view page.
- Record edit page.
- View page of a record the activity is related to.

.. caution::

   The ability to view and write comments depends on the permissions and role settings defined in the system for the 
   Comment entity.


On these pages, the user should: 

- Click the :guilabel:`Add Comment` button.

- Enter the comment into the the text-box.

- Click the :guilabel:`Choose File` button to add a file to the comments.

- Click the :guilabel:`Add Comment` button to save the comment.

.. hint::

    You can :ref:`edit <doc-entity-actions-edit>` the **Comment** entity and add new fields, if required.

For example, Ellen Rowel was a task "Email change needed", which required her to change the email address of 
Mr. Jeffrey Maynard.

- First, Ellen Rowel opened the **My Tasks** grid.

- Michael Buckley from the Marketing department opened the Tasks grid and opened the task View page. He can see both 
  comments made by Ellen Rowel and John Doe.

Case Comments
-------------

Case comments work in a similar manner, except there is an additional **Make Public** check box. You can use it to 
define if the comment must be public on Zendesk.
