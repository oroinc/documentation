OroCommerce’s dashboard gives you as a B2B seller the ability to quickly and easily obtain the relevant data needed to assess business performance.

With Ecommerce Dashboard, you get an instant insight of the following statistics:

* Commerce statistics: total revenue, number of orders placed, their average value, abandoned revenue, etc.
* customer activity: new and returning customer rates and information about site visits and bounce rates.
* Other: purchase funnel, orders, and revenue graphs.


If you use OroCommerce without OroCRM, deafult Dashboard gives you quick access to the frequently used actions in Quick Launchpad as an alternative to the Shortcuts option. You also can review recent emails and your calendar. 

In addition, you can create and manage your own custom dashboard to track the most relevant data.
