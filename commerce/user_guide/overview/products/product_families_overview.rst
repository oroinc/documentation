A product family is a set of the :ref:`product attributes <products--product-attributes>` that are enough to store complete information about the products of a similar type (e.g., TV attributes vs T-shirts attributes).
In the product family, attributes are organized into attribute groups that are displayed as titled sections on the OroCommerce storefront.

By default, there is a product family that groups all system attributes.
System attributes are mandatory for any product family as they contain core product details.

.. note::

   You can rearrange the groups and attributes in the groups inside the family. Out of the box, these system attributes are organized into the following structure:

   * **General attributes**: SKU, Name, Description, Short Description
   * **Images attributes**: Images
   * **Inventory attributes**: Inventory Status
   * **Product Prices attributes**: Product Prices
   * **SEO attributes**: Meta Title, Meta Keywords, Meta Description
