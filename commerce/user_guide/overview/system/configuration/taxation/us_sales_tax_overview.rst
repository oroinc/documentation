US sales tax for digital products
---------------------------------

Ensure that your US sales tax for digital products is included in your purchase quotes and orders when you sell to the US customers or from the US warehouse.

To label digital product codes in OroCommerce as taxable in US:

1. Navigate to **System > Configuration > Commerce > Taxation > US Sales Tax**.

2. Clear the **Use Default** check and click on **Choose the value**. To filter list of product tax codes, start typing the code name. The list refreshes automatically to show the values matching the text you enter. Once the necessary product code is found, select it to add to the Digital Products Tax Codes list.

3. Click **Save**.
