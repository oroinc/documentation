Shipping Tracking
-----------------

.. begin

When a customer user submits an order, they provide the shipping address and, optionally, the *Do Not Ship Later Than* date. Based on this information and their selected shipping method, they may see the shipping cost estimate. After a sales person adds the shipping service and their tracking number to the order, customer user can track the delivery (if this option is provided by the shipping company).

To add a tracking information about the shipping to the order, in Management Console:

1. Navigate to **Sales > Orders** using the main menu.

#. Click on the necessary order to view its details.

#. Click **Shipping Tracking**.

   Some orders may be delivered in multiple portions due to the circumstances related to the delivery time or delivered volume.

   To provide tracking details for additional shipping, click **+ Add** and enter the method and tracking number.

4. Click **Save**.

After the tracking information for shipping has been provided, it becomes available to the buyer on the front store.
