~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. begin

When editing the quote, a sales person may limit the shipping methods visible to customer.

To limit the shipping methods per quote:

#. Navigate to **Sales > Quotes** in the main menu.

#. Hover over the |IcMore| *more actions* menu to the right of the necessary quote and click |IcEdit| to start editing its details.

#. In the **Shipping Information** section, configure the shipping options available for the customer:

      :class: with-border

   a) In the **Shipping Methods** list, tick the boxes next to the shipping methods that you would like the customer to use for this order delivery.

      .. note:: When none of the methods are selected, the customer can use any of the listed methods.

      .. note:: Once you change the existing settings, the previous configuration will be saved for your information in the *Previously Selected Shipping Method* log above the list of the shipping methods.

   b) If necessary, select the preferred shipping method from the **Default Shipping Method** list. The customer will be able to change the option to any other available shipping method.

   c) Optionally, enter the **Overridden Shipping Cost Amount, USD** - a custom shipping cost that will be used instead of the one dynamically generated based on the shipping method selection.

   d) To enforce using only the default Shipping method, enable **Shipping Method Locked** flag.

   e) Tick the **Allow Unlisted Shipping Methods** box to allow using the shipping method that is already selected as a default one, even if it is disabled in this quote configuration.
