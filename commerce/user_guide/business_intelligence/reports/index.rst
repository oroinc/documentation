Reports
=======

In OroCommerce and OroCRM, you can create reports based on the details of any entity available in the system.

You can get easy-to-understand adjustable reports on the budgets and activity of different
customers, on statuses of carts and the current state of actual and potential sales, on the performance of your
:ref:`marketing effort <user-guide-marketing>`, specifics of recent :ref:`activities <user-guide-activities>`, etc.

There is a number of out-of-the-box reports, such as `Leads by Date <https://www.orocrm.com/documentation/current/user-guide-sales-tools/b2b-sales/leads#doc-leads-reports>`_ and
`Opportunities by Status <https://www.orocrm.com/documentation/current/user-guide-sales-tools/b2b-sales/opportunities/reports#user-guide-opportunities-reports>`_, but you can also create your own custom reports.

System reports are read-only. You can view the report output and filter the resulting data.
