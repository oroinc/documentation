Before You Begin
----------------

.. begin_product_configuration

Ensure that you have configured:

* :ref:`Product units <sys--commerce--product--product-units>` --- to select the primary product unit and its precision.
* Product image watermarks (:ref:`globally <sys--commerce--product--product-images>` and :ref:`per website <sys--websites--commerce--product--product-images>`) --- to add a branded watermark to all the product images.
* Product image gallery (:ref:`globally <sys--commerce--product--product-images--gallery-slider-global>`, :ref:`per organization <sys--users--organization--commerce--products--gallery-slider>`, and :ref:`per website <sys--websites--commerce--product--gallery-slider>`) --- to use popup or inline view for the image gallery.
* Image preview on product listing page (:ref:`globally <sys--commerce--product--product-images--image-preview--global>`, :ref:`per organization <sys--commerce--product--product-images--image-preview--organization>`, and :ref:`per website <sys--commerce--product--product-images--image-preview--website>`) --- to see the product image gallery instead of the product page when clicking on the image in the product listing.
* :ref:`Product families <products--product-families>` and :ref:`product attributes <products--product-attributes>` --- to design a structure for product information.
* :ref:`Price attributes <user-guide--products--price-attributes>` --- to add custom parameters where you can store the price-related information (e.g. MRSP) that may be used in the rule-based price lists to calculate the price for the buyer.
* New arrivals flag (:ref:`globally <sys--commerce--product--new-arrivals>`, :ref:`per organization <sys--users--organization--commerce--products--new-arrivals>`, and :ref:`per website <sys--websites--commerce--products--new-arrivals>`) --- to highlight the new products in your web catalog.
* Featured products segment (:ref:`globally <sys--commerce--product--featured-products>`, :ref:`per organization <sys--users--organization--commerce--products--featured-products>`, and :ref:`per website <sys--websites--commerce--products--featured-products>`) -- to store the selected products that are displayed on the crowded paths of you website.
* Related products (:ref:`globally <sys--commerce--catalog--relate-products>`, :ref:`per organization <sys--users--organization--commerce--catalog--related-products>`, and :ref:`per website <sys--websites--commerce--catalog--related-products>`) --- to bind similar products or those that compliment each other, like the item and its accessories.
