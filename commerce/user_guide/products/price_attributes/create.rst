      :class: with-border

#. Type in the price attribute name (that is used as a UI label) and the field name that is used in the code and in the database to refer to the price attribute container.

#. Select the currencies that are supported for this price attribute:

   * Click on the currency to select only one of them.

   * Hold *Ctrl* and click to add a currency to the selection.
