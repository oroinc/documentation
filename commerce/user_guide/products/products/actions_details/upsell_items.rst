Manage Up-Sell Products
-----------------------

Once the core product information is saved, you may configure up-sell items to show in the **Related Items** section in the product details in the management console, and in the **Up-Sell Products** section next to the product details in the storefront.

Use up-sell items to bind products that should be promoted when the buyer is viewing the product details. More expensive alternatives of the model, upgrade options, and additional parts are good fit for up-sell items.

To add up-sell items to the product information:

1. Navigate to the **Products > Products** using the main menu.
#. Hover over the |IcMore| **More Options** menu to the right of the item and click the |IcView| **View** icon to preview its details.
#. Navigate to the **Related Items** section and click the |IcEdit| **Quick Edit** link in the section header.

   The Related Items page appears.

#. Click the **Up-sell Products** tab.

#. Click **Select Up-Sell Items**.

#. In the **Select Up-Sell Items For** dialog:

   a) Select the **Is Related** check boxes next to the products to mark them as related. Use filter to limit the number of listed products and find the necessary items.

   b) Click **Select Products**.

   This will close the dialog and update the related items list with the products you have selected.

   .. note:: To delete a related item, click |IcDelete| **Delete**  next to it.

#. Once you are done adding the related items, click **Save and Close**.
