--------------------------------

.. begin

You can choose whether to use popup or inline view for the image gallery in the front store.

To configure image gallery options globally:

1. Navigate to the system configuration (click **System > Configuration** in the main menu).
2. Select **Commerce > Product > Product Images** in the menu to the left.

.. note::
   For faster navigation between the configuration menu sections, use :ref:`Quick Search <user-guide--system-configuration--quick-search>`.

The following page opens.

.. image:: /configuration_guide/img/configuration/product/product_images/ImageGallery.png
   :class: with-border

3. When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is enabled, image gallery in the front store will take the following form:

   .. image:: /configuration_guide/img/configuration/product/product_images/ImageGalleryEnabled.png
      :class: with-border

   By clicking on the image, the pop up gallery will be displayed in the middle of the screen:

   .. image:: /configuration_guide/img/configuration/product/product_images/ImageGalleryEnabled2.png
      :class: with-border

4. When **Popup Gallery on Product View** is disabled, the image gallery will take the form of an inline view:

   .. image:: /configuration_guide/img/configuration/product/product_images/ImageGalleryDisabled.png
      :class: with-border

   Flick through the pictures in the gallery by pressing < or > arrows without leaving the product page.

   .. note:: By default, **Popup Gallery on Product View** is enabled.

5. Click **Save Settings**.
