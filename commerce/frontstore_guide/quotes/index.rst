A quote in OroCommerce may be used to negotiate with the sales person (e.g. request a better price, more convenient quantities and additional services). It may be created in response to your request for quote, or as a result of the your direct communication with the sales person. Once you are happy with the offer in the quote and are ready to proceed with the order, you can shall accept the quote and submit an order.
